[{"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: 1 October, 2019", "Review": "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:This overall game is good. It doesnt always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it really shines.The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with the DCV, this is considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). With that said, dungeons (currently The Shattered Throne, Pit of Heresy, Prophecy which is free to all players, and Grasp of Avarice) and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, and Vault of Glass which is free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so dont shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. Tis only polite). Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I really enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, its fine I guess, but Ive never liked PvP thats dependent, in large part, on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)Dont be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.Some stuff just wont be explained in game. Its not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.For anything that you cant easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that wed be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. Now is a great time to be getting into Destiny 2. The fact that a representative chunk of this game is now free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere. [Do your research before you buy older expansions, specifically regarding the removal of content and the DCV https://www.bungie.net/en/Guide/dcv]If youre looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. Remember, everyone is starting at ~1100 light level, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaigns pre-Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light, followed by the upcoming expansions Witch Queen > Lightfall > TBA. Forsaken campaign/the Tangled Shore will be inaccessible after the launch of Witch Queen, set for Feb 2022]Eyes up, guardian.Footnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPSs, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Shadowkeeps launch, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If Ive missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and Ill do my best to update this periodically. [Updated again with the announced removal of sunsetting and lower seasonal power caps during Season 13, per https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124]-----------------TL:DR: Its good. Not perfect, but really good. And since its free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If youre overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.-----------------Sites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful) Beginners Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007The DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/Destiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.comDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/Light gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/Braytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/Datto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDwIf youve played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.Story Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

Its a solid FPS, with fun and mixed mechanics, fun abilities, and a good variety of weapons.Its a game that I have spent over 2k hours on, was my first game to break 1k on, and is a game of which I have spent literal hundreds on, both for myself and friends.It is one of the only games I preorder content for.But is it a game I recommend to new players?And this is what breaks my heart. Because I CANNOT recommend this game to new players. Not in its current state. Not unless things improve.STORY:The story of Destiny is rich and indepth. Were far beyond the point where it was hidden in lore cards. DLC has fully cast characters, often good narrative beats, and is generally a good time.Seasons have gone from being a thing with loot and an activity, to near episodic stories told over weeks.The story in Destiny has never been better...And never been worse.Due to the DVC, new players are locked out of two whole years of story, and soon to be a third.They miss out on critical character arcs, and narrative context for current events.What content remains is a mix of old and new, clashing content and contexts that leave new players confused as to who is who, and where theyve gone.ACTIVITIES:There are a number of core playlists that offer casual and hardcore experiences. There is endgame content for those who thirst for it. There are seasonal activities that offer a variety of fun side activities. There are bounties, challenges, and triumphs to chase.But there used to be so much more.Some of the most fun, and most rewarding activities are gone, and whilst the newer activities are fun...They fail to live up to the past so far. And they too are soon to vanish.COST:This is where Destiny fails the most.You can buy:- DLCs- Seasons- Cosmetic MTX- Transmog MTXAll of this can add up to a high cost, especially for newer players coming in.All of the \"free\" content has been stripped away to the core playlists, of which you are occasionally locked out of for the week if you dont have the DLC, (nightfalls).Furthermore, instead of some parts of vaulted content becoming free, (subclasses, activities, weapons), Bungie is instead making this an EXTRA cost in the form of a mini DLC.All of this results in a horrendous experience for new players, who starting out:- Are facing a (Technically) pay to win economy, where subclasses and weapons are locked behind DLC paywalls in PVP content.- Are left with no guidance of what they can, or cannot do.- Are limited to only a handful of core activities, of which sometimes are unavailable.I cannot recommend this game to a new player, because the red tape of what is and isnt available behind which paywall and how long itll exist before its gone, and what isnt going...Is all too much.Please Bungie. Fix your sh*t.Other games do transmog right. Other games let you keep your season passes once the season is over because you brought it.Other games dont strip away story and content from both the free and paid players.The DVC is a necessary evil, but with each vaulting the new players are left with less, and everyone is left with a bigger mess.I know you can make this right.

The dev team and the players make up the best gaming community Ive been a part of.Bungie is the most transparent, bold, and dedicated development team Ive seen in a long time. They dont do everything perfectly, of course, but they own up to mistakes, they address player feedback and adjust the game accordingly. Just watch their Shadowkeep ViDocs, its so down to earth, and their actions have proved its not an act. They feel like distant friends more than developers, and you can tell they truly care about everyone involved in making/playing this game.Now as for me,I started as a solo player with nobody to try this new game out with (I Started in vanilla)After I LFGd and learned my first raid, I joined a clan and made some great friends who I had an absolute blast with. Then I realized raids were such a good time, I wanted to share that experience with people who might not have a group to do it with, so I became a raid sherpa/guide.After many runs, lots of Leviathan, mainly, I realized I had a knack for teaching these, and wanted to grow a community from it.Now, since starting my own clan and adding 40+ people, I have made so many new friends and had so many hours of fun with strangers coming together to play my favorite game ever.  Im someone prone to feeling lonely, and seeing people I brought together have fun chatting and becoming friends makes me feel like I belong.Through this extremely well-crafted game, Ive been able to build a community of players where we all feel like part of a space magic family.

TL:DR at the bottom.This is a review by a guy who has a total of almost 2,900 hours at the time of writing, cumulative from BattleNet and Steam eras. Would have definitely been a lot more if I wasnt stuck on console for several months and wasnt in school or work when (and after) Steam support was enabled.I love this game. The universe, the lore, in particular. I have the Chronicler title for a reason, and if I didnt love the game world, I wouldnt have spent even 1000 hours on it. Probably not even 500.The gameplay and current meta as-is are rapidly degrading. Does it have fun areas? Sure. Is it good fun for new players? Probably. Is it good for players that have been playing the Destiny series since vanilla Destiny 1? Most current sources say no. So, Ill give my opinions below for someone just downloading, or someone purchasing the games expansions.The free base game lacks the activities of the current seasonal structure but still has public seasonal events (such as the current guardian games). Is it fun? For a bit. The free campaign is a bit grindy at certain parts and doesnt have the best loot drops, but Id likely still have fun with it if I hadnt played it before.There are no REAL re-play-ability features in any of the campaigns, apart from strikes and crucible, but the former gets tiring quickly and the latter loses its spark from time to time. I dont remember if gambit is still free for everyone, but its in the same murky water.The paid expansions are interesting, kinda fun solo (for the most part) and definitely fun in a group. If you plan to get any, make sure you get Forsaken and/or Shadowkeep (the upgrade edition is 50 bucks, cheaper than getting both individually). I enjoyed both, and they were fun for a while. Emphasis on a while. Ill get to that later.Keep in mind that the other campaigns (red war, warmind, and curse of osiris) come first in the timeline.The other main paid feature (currently) are the Seasons. Each season comes with a different suite of content that will (currently) be phased out at the end of the season to make room for new content. This INCLUDES all matchmaking activities and triumphs attached to that particular season, as well as the seasonal badges. Sundial is a perfect example of this. If you dont know what Im talking about, google it. It comes from the most recent lapsed season.The current season is very, VERY bland and tedious. It revolves almost ENTIRELY around Bounty completions, small tasks that have no real impact on gameplay other than to mix up what you need to do with your arsenal to complete their contents. The grind takes an age if you dont have days straight to play, and ends up with very little satisfaction because of how little content there is.This is only a real issue if youve been playing the game fairly regularly. If youre new to the game and/or universe, this issue will be far less apparent, and may not even show up until the next season due to the plethora of content available for a fresh character to complete. Unfortunately, however, this content drought cycle has become a VERY strong pattern. Luckily one that does not make me pay much for it, but one that still hurts all the same.Seasons are purchasable via a season pass or individually. Im not sure if costs are the same either way, the option disappears after purchase of the current pass.Contents include the seasonal content alongside something similar to the season passes in Fortnight, Division 2, COD, etc. without being the useless cash grabs that those ones are. I actually like the system of the reward track accompanying new content rather than it being separate from that releases dlc. Are there items that encourage play? Yes. Is there a way to buy levels in the pass? Yes, but the items within the pass do not a strong character make, and purchasing levels is FULLY LOCKED until the season is almost over, rendering the possibility of pay-to-win being almost impossible. Granted, f2p content does not have a large pool of excellent weaponry, but thats been a fact since before the game went free-to play, and I dont think the difference in loot pools is nearly as significant as some people would claim. Especially with the new armor system.Theres also loot boxes, but you can earn (most of) the items in the Eververse through gameplay and bright dust bounties. Does this mean Im advocating the required completion of bounties for most cosmetics? Hell no. Im borderline pissed that there STILL arent any cosmetics attainable through normal gameplay and activity completion apart from the prestige Leviathan ornaments.Now, would I recommend this game? This is very complicated, as you can probably tell from the above.For a new player with low dedication / time allocation to the universe of the game? Yes!Theres a plethora of content to enjoy out of the box, and the fact that its only 60 bucks for 3 years of content is quite the steal.To a new or returning player familiar with the lore, universe and with a lot of time on their hands to complete everything the game throws at us? Probably not. It really depends:- If you havent played D2 yet, you might get a good couple hundred hours of play time out of the box between grinding out the campaigns and hitting endgame earlier than intended. For those of you, the 60 bucks might be worth it.- For people who played vanilla and/or forsaken and/or shadowkeep? I assume you know most of the problems I mentioned above, and know to wait and see what they plan to change with their content-cycling system before you come back. I definitely wouldnt recommend a return at this point unless you want to get some friends into the game, or want to grind out the seasonal activities to see where the story is leading.TL:DR; I recommend this game with a few heavy warnings:1- If you plan on playing this game for an extended period of time, expect heavy content drought between season releases.2- If you are returning to the game, I would suggest waiting or doing research on how Bungie is changing content-cycle systems.3- If youve purchased or completed shadowkeep and/or forsaken and plan on getting the seasons, do NOT EXPECT THE SEASONS TO REFLECT THIS AMOUNT OF CONTENT. Seasonal content is often particularly gimmicky. Particularly, overuse of bounty mechanics is a huge let down.", "Author": "DaBlizz", "Hours": 2392.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 1, 2020", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "Ryphin", "Hours": 50.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 27, 2021", "Review": "The perfect description of a toxic relationship", "Author": "[A]dmiral [V]ulva [G]angrene", "Hours": 1028.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 21, 2021", "Review": "Ok, I am going to give a brief but concise review on this wonderful bipolar game. In summary: Most Destiny 2 players joking but correctly describe this game as \" I hate Destiny 2, its my favorite game\". For those unknowing of Destiny 2s gameplay loop, it may seem strange. But if you ever jump in, you will quickly understand why.This is.... is a game for masochists. There is soooooooo much to do and never enough hours in a week to do it all in. You will play for hours grinding away your life trying to get items in this game. If you are a completionist OCD gamer, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST PLAYING THIS GAME. This game will trigger you in all the worst ways. There are FOMO yearly events on top of the tri monthly seasonal content that will have you obsessively playing away your life trying to impossibly do everything as quickly as possible before the events/seasons expire. I am not even touching the predatory Eververse store, thats just pure FOMO glitter bait. And you cannot escape that in any triple A game anymore. Not even a listed con, just a fact. What IS predatory however is Bungies nebulous changes of the game every few months to a year. If you drop this game for a bit and come back several months to a year later, its a completely different game literally due to their new content vault system. The part that makes it nebulous is that they are vaulting paid DLC content you have previously purchased and played. Which is a huge red flag for new forms of predatory DLC FOMO. Literal FOMO for DLC purchases on top of the usual season pass exclusivity content. Once again, if you are an OCD completionist. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Its not good for your mental health. Its a damn fun game, but you can get pulled in, in the worst ways. If you enjoy this game casually, you are a stout soul because this game is for you. Its fun for a few mindless hours, but for endgame playing, its a mindless grind that will have your soul wither away from either missing FOMO events because of IRL commitments or just the sheer amount of it you need to do to get the items you want to drop. I walked away from this game for my mental health and because I had an epiphany of how dangerous this games true predatory nature is. As well as the very dangerous DLC transaction model Bungie is positioning into place with Witch Queen. I refunded my WQ Digital Edition Deluxe because I am that concerned about it.

If thats all you care about then you might want to give the game a try. D2 has just recently begun transitioning to a more RPG-focused style of play so some things such as mods, perks and skill trees arent fully fleshed out yet. That said you probably wont notice this unless youre in the end-game trying to min-max your build.The early game can be a little challenging for new players because of all the various systems at play. Think of it as an easier Warframe or Path of Exile. There are plenty of resources to find out more about the game however, particularly on Reddit. /r/ShardItKeepIt for deciding which weapons to keep or discard. /r/CruciblePlaybook for PvP tips. /r/DestinyTheGame as the official unofficial subreddit for the game, and /r/Destiny2 for the memes. You can also look to /r/Fireteams or the Destiny mobile app to find people to play with.In terms of free content, the first three campaigns are unlocked -  The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind.  You also have access to all strikes (replayable mini-missions), PvP and PvEvP maps and modes, and all 9 planets/destinations. Additionally there are three raids available -  Leviathan, Spire of Stars, and Eater of Worlds.  These are challenging but fun 6-man activities that require a lot of coordination and skill to beat. Theres a lot more F2P activities as well that you will find once you start playing. They may not have all been amazing at launch, but after 1-2 years of updates and tuning theyve never been more enjoyable. Forsaken  is the first paid DLC. Purchase of it comes with the raids  Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow,  as well as several exotic weapons. Even if you dont or wont raid, its worth it for the story alone. Its a sci-fi western tale of revenge for a dear friend, and is Destinys highest narrative moment.  Shadowkeep  is the second and newest paid DLC. While not as impressive as  Forsaken  story-wise, theres still a lot of content to do especially considering how its bundled with the current Season Pass. This is the story of how another ancient threat is discovered under the Moon. Sounds underwhelming yes, but saying anymore would require spoilers. The current Season focuses on an army of machines controlled by sentient milk that invades the solar system. Absolutely worth it. Theres also a raid included here,  Garden of Salvation,  as well as an upcoming dungeon.All in all, theres an overwhelming amount of content here if youre a new player. It may be daunting, but play through the (optional but highly recommended) campaigns and youll soon find yourself at home with the game.

When the changes and future plans leading up to the next DLC take effect, I will be updating this review.Edit 2: Last played on June 26, 2021. I have since uninstalled the game with no plans of returning anytime soon. Anyone who gets triggered by my review, its at your own expense. Happy reading.TL;DR: largely NOT free-to-play, core content removal, planned obsolescence, lack of play-testing and playerbase neglect, has left a large amount of current players feeling disrespected and disinterested.As much as I love playing this game, to eager, new players thinking about getting into it: DONT. With the developers design decisions removing a large amount of the games content, putting it into a \"content vault\" for use in the future, in the games current state, that \"free to play\" button on the store page is a lie. A majority of the game is currently locked behind a paywall, with many core activities only accessible if players buy the DLCs. There is no reduction in price for the DLCs from Bungies side for this lack of content, so, buyers beware. You will be paying full price for DLCs that had about 80% of its content left unplayable or removed.Last year, Bungie implemented \"sunsetting\" gear, a.k.a. the concept of planned obsolescence in the game. It is already in effect. 2 out of the 3 latest DLCs have [expired] gear that is unusable in the current season. This gear will be updated to have a new expiration date next season, however, the [expired] gear that players collect now, will not have their expiration date(s) updated. Players who invested time into obtaining gear that they want from the activities in the 2 earlier DLCs, have to grind for it all over again. No reduction of material costs to upgrade gear have been taken into account for the introduction of sunsetting, removing any incentive to continue the grind. Destiny 2 content creators on YouTube have also eaten their words. After initially supporting the idea of sunsetting to reduce powercreep, a majority of them now agree that it is bad for the game.With the new DLC, Beyond Light, the developers introduced a new playable subclass, Stasis. Basically magic space ice wizardry. In the games PvP modes, these new subclasses are absolutely over-tuned. From a FPS players perspective, Stasis has disrupted the core of FPS gameplay, by literally allowing players to be frozen where they stand, allowing for easy frags. Slowing, as a game mechanic, also causes players to not have their shots registered to hit their target, even when they have their sights directly on them. It was obvious that they released the new subclasses without play-testing, to trap new players into buying Beyond Light. Also, they removed several PvP maps, with no new modes, entirely neglecting their PvP playerbase. How about that, a regression of content, in a live-service game.I will continue to see this game through. But if the above sounds like good decisions made by developers who respect your time invested into their game and know what you want as a player, and not a game in its death throes, I envy your blissful ignorance.", "Author": "SianSperm", "Hours": 1691.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: August 24, 2020", "Review": "I HAVE SPENT(or wasted): 1000 HRS OF MY LIFE ON THIS GAME (Which is nothing compared to some of you, but I like the number 1000)And therefore, I now feel like an entitled idiot who will now give you a review. Because after spending 1000 hrs of my oxygen and brain-cell power on this game, I feel like I know just little bit about it. A little bit. So without any more stupid rambling, heres my poorly constructed, naive, and somewhat botched review of Destiny 2...*clears throat*I joined the ranks of the Vanguard when D2 was on the ol Battlenet, back when Activision still had its mits on Bugies precious player base. And since its migration to the new platform here at Steam, there have indeed been some changes in latency, player-base, and server issues. Which to be honest, I think we all expected right from the word go.If you are starting D2 as a new light with no background knowledge, it is important to remember that progressing through every task given to you is going to get you that light-level advantage when leveling up your guarding for the first time. This is where the first hiccup comes in.. Since we had the big Shadowkeep update, trying to figure out where to go next in your quests can be a small nightmare. I spent an entire night with one of my clans blueberries trying to help her figure out where to go before we succumbed to Googling the directions like tourists in a foreign city. If Bungie could potentially alter the quest tracking to perhaps make the major quests more linear in their pursuit, itd be a whole lot easier for people coming in with no prior knowledge to the games mechanics.That said, If you need to go in blind, always check your destinations tab and hover over each planet where the flashing symbol is relevant to your quest. Each major DLC will have a symbol that you can follow through the Solar System.To get to the major stories: Amanda Holiday herself is where you will find the major story line journeys as you begin your career as a magnificent Space Moron.Destiny 2 I think appeals to people who have a good eye for lore and rich environments. The first thing that overwhelmed me was how detailed some of the biomes were. Especially the Dreaming City, which I think we can all agree is one heck of a place! Its pretty important to take note of those small details that Bungie has put in, down to reading the lore books that are there too. One aspect however that the current player base rolls their eyes at is the bounty system: Bounties are the backbone of the seasonal progress. And while I get that Bungo has tried to centre its play style around bounty completions, which can get repetitive, you do have to engage with this mechanic to build your light level.What D2 additionally excels at is creating a place where you can progress at your own speed, or have your fireteam/clan help you through certain areas that you need help with. The Clan system offered by D2 is a standout in that it allows you to connect your skills with that of others to accomplish tasks that are integral to the game. There is some content that does very much need a fireteam to be completed. But if youre a magical rootin tootin alien shootin god of computers games, then running solo can always give you big results too. The main consensus is however that joining a clan is is your best interest. And that is because the gain you can receive in loot and bounty-clocking is a lot better when you have other Space Morons with you terrorising the universe.  Which brings me to the PVP element. *Deep sigh*As a PVE enthusiast, I thought Id never really delve into the PVP elements solely because my level of skill is appalling. I know Shaxx is very encouraging everytime I go to see him, but Im 99.9% sure hes just being nice to poor little Miss D, who repeatedly falls of the map while she is scoped in.With how many people do have accounts solely for the purpose of playing Crucible Competitive and Trials of Osiris, you are going to find some of your matches are going to be simply dying repeatedly to laggy space-apes who are not going to change from using their shotguns. The toxicity level of these groups (which can sometimes be entire clans of elitist PVP lunatics) you really have to ignore if you want to try and push your way through the ranks. However if you have a supportive clan (like mine) youll find after a few rounds and finding your optimal loadout, you will enjoy it! Following the meta on weapon types can help you get your feet in a match, but be aware you will not be liked for it! Finally we have the guardian classes themselves. I feel this is absolutely worth talking about, and when you look at the pop culture around each class, you cant help but be entertained by it all. What you play effects very much your play style: Hunters are often high speed, high damage dealing plucky little acrobats with big mouths. Warlocks are the bookworms with a ego who think they are the only reason the team didnt wipe on the boss. And Titans... well. We just like Titans because they are easy to pick and often have Crayola dust left on their helmets after too many snacks.Jokes aside, a well constructed fireteam/raid team/6 stack will have at least one of each class. This generally distributes the skill pattern quite well, and some of the most stress-free raids Ive ever run have had a good balance of all 3.Again. However:If you want to run yourself through most of this game for the challenge, Titans do possess the skill trees that can more effectively push you through the more difficult situations you may find yourself in. Yes, we pick on them relentlessly, but they do play a big role in Destiny, and will continue to be fantastic Space Apes into the future of D2.Well. Ive finished dinner and written 6 or so paragraphs, so I suppose this is where you end a review? I have no idea. As mentioned afore, I have the writing competency of a scientific calculator if you had taped fake nails on it and asked it to do a bachelor of journalism. All-in-all, I have immensely enjoyed this game, and will continue to. Yes this game has some serious bugs, but it is still lovable in its own buggy way. Have a go. Watch some guides. Get a good clan (come join ours its the best). Go give the Darkness the stiff upper lip and have a gaff with Zavala. 10/10 for Creativity and Originality.7/10 for Space Magic. 1/10 for Chonky Crayons.8/10 for Gameplay.11/10 for Good TImes!Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

If you look at my most-played games, Borderlands 2 & 2.5 top the list, followed by MachineGames first Wolfenstein games, then the Deus Ex reboot and Half-Life 2 sitting pretty at 200+ hours. DOOM 2016 is way up there as well as the original Rage. Honorable mention for Starbreeze/Vin Diesels \"Riddick\" games. Good stuff! Anyway, you get the idea. I like shiny shooty looty (mostly) story-driven single-player sci-fi games a whole lot.I am not a fan of multiplayer games, though. The last multiplayer arena shooter I played and actually enjoyed was one of the really old Unreal Tournaments. Lets just say I was a bit wary about getting into this. I was peripherally aware of the drama surrounding the original Destiny, and Ive never played a Bungie game before, so I was all set to ignore this until a friend peer-pressured me into checking it out. :P (And I owe him a beer or two for doing so!)So if youre like me, going into Destiny 2 blind, heres the skinny: You are a post-human gun-toting space wizard and the Sol system is under attack by unpleasant dudes from another galaxy. Or maybe this galaxy. Doesnt matter. Theres a lot of them and theyre ugly and you need to kill them or theyll eat you and/or sign you up for outrageous student loans or something. The motives are always pretty clear for D2s interplanetary Rambo pub crawl. In other words: yes, Private Hudson, it is another bug hunt.Leveling in D2 is borrowed from, among others, Vermintide 2s equipment-level system (i.e. your character gains levels by how powerful your gear is), and the equipment is doled out in drops from your kills and quest rewards, very much like Borderlands loot-and-shoot mechanic. Lots of comparing rifles, helmets, boots, cheese, rocket launchers, cats, pianos, laundry hampers, etc.Youve got the skills to pay the bills, though, by which I mean D2s class and skill system makes me unreasonably happy. You have 3 character slots, 3 races, and 3 main classes. Each of the 3 main classes have 3 elemental subclasses that you can switch to at any time, and each subclass can tweak their individual skills nearly on the fly. In one of my favorite MMOs from way back when, you could slot in certain skills from any of the classes in the game, on top of your main class/job, and the amount of gameplay customization this provides is significant. You get to tweak the skills of your chosen subclass even further with either the Forsaken or Shadowkeep expansion. (The consensus seems to be that Forsaken is the better value, FYI.)Character customization (face, hair, etc) is a bit bare, but its not a big deal as there is a massive amount of gear customization. Dye your sword (yes, there are 3rd-person swords) pink, paint your helmet black or green or whatever the hell you want with semi-rare drops called \"shaders\"; more infrequent drops include specific skins for specific gear, which you can also dye some insane color. Once you acquire a certain shader or skin, and you use it up on a trash piece of gear... you dont have to hope for another random drop of the vanity item. Your pickups are all stored in a \"collections\" tab, where you can just grab them again for varying amounts of in-game (not cashy money) currency. Score!Its a system that reminds me of Assassins Creed: Odysseys persistent weapon/armor skins (whatever gear you picked up, its skin was saved to your character so you could always switch them in and out as per your fancy). Small thing, but showing consideration to the player and their time is sadly not something you always find in AAA games.D2 is huge. It takes place across the solar system that we all know and love, no matter how many planets you think are worthy enough of being called planets. This seems like a minor point, but getting to bounce around a bunch of worlds that you probably know the names of by heart, and seeing such stunning representations of the beauty of our sister planets... it all creates a deeply satisfying and familiar hook so youre not bored to tears by your 50th visit to planet Flibbertygibbet. And it also helps that Bungie hires writers and scriptwriters who clearly know what the hell theyre doing, because for once, for ONCE, Im not always skipping cutscenes or dialogue -- most of the quests feature a lot of good voicework and the script is quite funny a lot of the time.That may or may not be due to the fact that there are a lot of famous people providing voiceovers[www.imdb.com] in D2. Your mileage may vary, of course, but this is a game with massive production values and it shows.What else... gunplay is freaking fantastic. I havent enjoyed visceral shooting like this since Wolfenstein or DOOM 2016. Thats the other thing that Im constantly surprised by, that this is a really great shooter all by itself. In the open-world maps your player transitions seamlessly from open-world to instanced sections of the maps, meaning that once you enter a named cave or a ruin or whatever, no one else can come in with you other than your party, so if you really hate playing in a massively online blah-blah, you have plenty of options. Aside from raids and the like, its a very solo-friendly game as far as I can tell. D2 may borrow from the loot-and-shoot school of gaming but they took the time to build an astounding selection of guns, many of which feel and sound unique enough at lower tiers to give you a lot of versatility when youre still starting out.And to top it off, the game community is really quite pleasant! Your mileage may vary, again, but theres some obvious love for this game in the playerbase which comes out often in random interactions.In summary: if youre looking for a new addiction, and you like a little gun with your space opera, get stuck in. You may regret it if you have one of those \"social lives\" that people keep whispering about!

You invest another couple of hours in grinding & at the end of the day ( or tomorrow, cause u wont stop, lol ) , you finally get that gear . Now you feel satisfied . You open your character menu and check that weapon . You are completely stunned/surprised . The weapon that you just got has absolute god tier perks in every column ( we call them god rolls in destiny ) . Its the weapon roll that your friends were chasing and still havent got . Theres a guy out there who invested 100+ hours in trials , has 50 flawless & still doesnt have god roll igneous but you get it first try on ten losses by jumping off the map. Now you are completely happy & immensely satisfied. You never felt this kind of happiness even when you graduated . You know that if u show it to your friends , they r really gonna get jealous & thats why you really want to show them . You get a raid exotic first try & your fireteam leader kicks you because of that , cause he still hasnt gotten it in 150 clears . But him kicking you in this case actually makes you more happy cause you know he is jealous of you.  Now that you have got the god roll , the next phase starts . You think of all the positive things about the game , how it has so many activites that you can play endlessly with your friends and never get bored , how the games replayability factor is good , even though the endgame is grindfest , you still feel like doing it & never get bored of it, how the devs always keep saying \" we are listening \" & keep fixing stuff/try their best. How you can exploit bugs/cheeses in this game without getting banned cause bungie themselves said its their fault if such bugs exist, how the community (inspite of being toxic many times) comes together to donate & help whenever a charity is conducted . Now that you are happy you start playing the game with a positive vibe until you set your eyes on another weapon .  The whole game is just you shifting your thoughts from positive to negative & vice versa from time to time , contradicting yourself & your own thoughts , but you will still keep playing & playing  & playing . You will eventually reach a point where you will have evrytg , & you dont feel like you need any new things anymore, but you will still keep playing. You wont know why you are playing the game anymore but you will still keep playing. You will get up at 3 AM in the midnight half asleep or sleep walking , load up destiny 2 , go to all vendors , collect their bounties and start doing them , all with your eyes closed . How you ask ? cause at  that point you would have already done each of those bounties a thousand times , so you would know subconsciously which bounty it will be from each vendor & even its objectives.  I read this in one of the other reviews - \" If you are playing this game only for pvp , then you are being delusional \" , that perfectly sums up the pvp experience . You will feel like pvp is balanced & unbalanced at the same time . Unbalanced? stasis of course . You might have the best aim in the world , sm hunter with with a shuriken will freeze you & knock you out or a titan with his melee will throw you off the map or a warlock with his infinite super glitch will keep killing you until the round/game ends . Bungie did fix the warlock glitch , how? by disabling it of course. Balanced ? again stasis . You will run against a lot of hackers on pc , and stasis is again the countermeasure . The cheater might have infinite health , the titan will throw him off the map with his melee, He might have perfect aim , well he cant shoot if he is frozen , can he?. Pretty ironic that I talked about actual legit players while referencing unbalance & cheaters/hackers while referencing balance . Thats the power of stasis.  So to sum it all up , do I recommend this game ? - Well YES , but actually NO.", "Author": "AjhStark", "Hours": 5483.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: January 30, 2020", "Review": "Likes:- Lots of high quality content to do, especially for a free to play game- Big immersive planets to explore and get lost in- Both pve and pvp modes are fun- The game is very pretty- Sound design, voice acting, soundtrack are very good- Core gameplay mechanics are polished and satisfying, such as gunplay and jumping and riding the sparrow Dislikes:-Unfriendly to new players because of the sheer amount of content they immediately have access to, with no clear indication of what the symbols on the map mean, combined with a disorganized quest menu, among other grievances.

I can, however say that if you havent played the game from the beginning, you will be missing out on a large chunk of items and assorted pieces of your in-game collection.  This doesnt bother me fortunately, but has come up and will come up more in the coming years as the Destiny Content Vault[bungie.net] rotates pieces of legacy content out of the game. Its a fun little hamster wheel to play with friends, no doubt about that.  I never thought I would enjoy doing raids, but after meeting a few clans Ive had my fill of fun with tight communication and game-play.I am, however rather conflicted when it comes to loot you gather. The weapons and armor you gather and invest resources into all are being given expiry dates of nearly a year, however a good portion of the game is marching straight into obsolescence and will no longer find use in endgame activities such as future raids, dungeons, and the Trials of Osiris. Take of that what you will, things will surely be turbulent in the coming years, with another expansion pack coming in September.Watch the game carefully, but more importantly make sure to have fun!-Negi", "Author": "Gelato", "Hours": 2898.4}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 20, 2021", "Review": "After probably what is more than 1000 total hours spent playing this game and recommending it to friends, I unfortunately can no longer conscientiously recommend the game to anyone. This will be a long review below the TL;DR.TL;DR: A predatory 4-layer monetization model, lack of respect for player time investment, removal of past content that you likely paid money for, massive Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) content implementations, player retention mechanics, and heavily skewed update rollouts in favor of slowing player progress over fixing bugs and balance issues.Monetization - The Big OneA Bungie employee has confirmed that with the launch of Witch Queen, both dungeons scheduled to release for the duration of the Witch Queen expansion will be sold separately for those who choose not to invest in the digital deluxe version of the game. So, for those who do not like to preorder games/expansions, which is probably quite a sizeable amount of the playerbase, there will be 3 layers of paywalls in order to play all of the content releasing during Witch Queen. You will be expected to pay the $40 upfront for the expansion, an additional $10 for each of the seasons you choose to purchase (totaling 4 seasons), and another undisclosed amount for each of the 2 dungeons you decide to purchase ($5-20? each). So, in total, if you choose not to purchase the digital deluxe version of the game, you can expect to pay anywhere from $90-120, which doesnt even include the separate Anniversary Pack, which costs an additional $25.On top of the triple layer content monetization, there is the Eververse store (a cosmetic shop), which is estimated to rake in a few hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Player Retention, FOMO, and Lack of Respect for Player InvestmentThe games \"seasons\" are designed to keep you coming back to the game each week and keep you playing for as long as possible. Content is trickle-fed to you each week with story updates and seasonal challenge updates. The story additions usually take just a few hours to complete, but the seasonal challenges can take several days to complete each weeks new challenges. At the end of the season, if you complete roughly 95% of the seasons total challenges, you get a large drop of Bright Dust (free currency for the Eververse store). Large enough, in fact, that it seems like extreme value to attempt to complete the final challenge. But lets say you didnt quite get there and missed out on finishing a few challenges, but the season is over. Can you just complete them later? Nope. You missed out. Too bad. Didnt get to see the last bit of the story from the season that just ended? Too bad (some do persist). Guess youll need to watch some YouTube videos to figure out what you missed. This alone gives a severe sense of FOMO. You HAVE to be there for the content or else youll miss out and it will, quite literally, never come back.Bungie has now taken to adjusting gun perks between seasons as well. If you were grinding for that perfect shotgun with the perfect perks, but never quite got it before they decided to change the perk pool, oh well. Other players now have that perfect roll that may even give them an edge in PvP, but you missed out because your luck wasnt quite good enough.If you want a particular Trials of Osiris weapon and werent lucky enough to get it with focused rolls, good luck. Your chances of getting that particular weapon with the perks you want from a randomly rolled Trials engram can range anywhere from 0.02% to 0.1%. You could grind this gamemode for literal days, weeks, maybe even months (since its only around on particular weekends) and still not get the weapon you want.The Destiny Content VaultAs of right now, all of the original D2 storyline content, as well as the entirety of the first and second expansions to be released for the game, are unplayable, because they have quite literally been removed from the game. With the upcoming release of Witch Queen, the story of The Forsaken expansion will also become fractured as a story essential zone is vaulted. Speaking of Forsaken (which, as I said, will be unplayable in 4 months), Bungie is still, STILL, charging $25 for that expansion. Some people will purchase the expansion for the $25 price point, the expansion will become free in December, frustrating these people, and then the content will be flat out taken away from them on February 22, 2022. Paying for content with the knowledge that you will no longer ever be able to access it sometime in the future is infuriating.The Destiny Content Vault has led to a completely fragmented new player experience. Which, by the way, the DCV was implemented right after Bungie overhauled the new player experience. A bit counter-productive, right? New and returning players no longer have a connected experience when they play Destiny. They are dropped into the middle of a fragmented world and story that they will only understand by doing homework in the form of watching YouTube videos.Bugs and The Development Focus/PipelinePlayers have been asking for new Gambit and PvP maps for years. Do they get them? No. Players have been asking for a Gambit overhaul for years. Has it happened? No. Sometimes PvP balance gets way out of line and particular guns become exceptionally strong, especially with the right perk roll. Surely itll get patched quickly, right? No. In fact, the timeline it takes for balance updates is on the scale of months. Not days. Not weeks. MONTHS.You know what DOES get fixed exceptionally quickly? Exploits that interfere with player retention mechanics. Players found a way to quickly farm a resource 10x faster than the intended route? Patched within the hour.Stockholm Syndrome/Boiling Frog and Sunk Cost FallacySo, if things are this bad, why are there still so many people playing? I have a few theories and I speak from personal experience.I was victim to sunk cost fallacy. I paid for the digital deluxe editions and when I inevitably got burned out on the game, I would still play the new seasons under the thought process of: \"Oh, I paid for them, I really should play them. Otherwise, Ive wasted my money.\" This is the sunk cost fallacy. \"Ive spent money on this game, I HAVE to play it to get that value.\" \"Ive invested so much time into this game, I cant stop playing now or that will have all been for nothing.\" During my stages of burnout, never once did I load up the game actually excited to play, it was only to continue making my investment and to satiate the Fear of Missing Out.Then there is Stockholm Syndrome. People who are literally so addicted to the game that Bungie could make any negative decision in the world and these particular players would still try to justify Bungies actions. You see this quite clearly with the new dungeon monetization model. \"Its not so bad, it means we may get even higher quality content!\" \"This doesnt matter to me, because Im a diehard Destiny 2 fan who ALWAYS buys the digital deluxe version of the expansions. Who cares!?\"Place a frog in a pot of water and slowly increase the temperature until it dies, none the wiser (Boiling Frog). Bungie is doing this by squeezing your wallet with every single piece of content they offer. When season passes became a thing: \"They need the extra money for dev purposes, its fine.\" Dungeons historically were included with either a season pass or an expansion. Now, that is no longer the case. On one side you have players saying that this is over the line and the other side arguing that \"it isnt so bad, they probably need development money\" (AKA the boiling frogs). Right now, its dungeons, but whos to say that in another years time exotic quests (which are also currently included in season passes) wont also be monetized separately?", "Author": "Oryth", "Hours": 722.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: September 3, 2021", "Review": "developed anger issues from this game", "Author": "Kitty Cat", "Hours": 436.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 26, 2019", "Review": "After a bit more than 180 hours I feel like I havent even scratched the surface of this game.

The feeling and look of the weapons, how you interact with the world around you is something you\u2019ll find just very rarely. Every Element of the world is visually thought out and the sound design of the game, especially with the newest game extensions just superb. How you can customize your own character can fascinate for hours and lets you tell your own whole story.Thought the rest:I started back in December of 2019. A friend asked me if I wanted to join, I never really played an MMO like Destiny 2, so I thought okay, lets give it a try. And I was Instantly hooked.It was just this mysterious Game where you could explore what felt like an entire star system for itself and just explore the different worlds, each telling a different story.And this game had a certain kid of magic. There just was so much to discover, the moment when a Quest for an unknown exotic weapon popped on your screen with special Activities and gorgeous new places bound to it. And oh boy the Raids. The Leviathan Raids were visually just stunning.And then, in the November of 2020 Bungie just removed all that magic the game had for me. With the new Beyond Light DLC they decided to remove 40% of the explorable Planets, They removed activities that just made the game what it was,3 whole campaigns, beloved activities like The Whisper\u2019, \u2018Zero Hour the whole Black Armory and its weapons, and screw it, I even miss the \u2018Escalation Protocol\u2019Also, they went removing 21 of those quest for exotic weapons, that made a huge part of the game,  while leaving 6 in game. Those Weapons are still obtainable in game, though to obtain them you need to grind out in some cases a dozen hours just to get enough materials to buy a certain one.Additionally they took 5 of the 7 Raids from the game.And what they added were 2 Planets, one being a recycled one from the previous game. With Stasis they gave us a new subclass element, players could abuse, which made the PvP-section of this game the most obnoxious part of the game for 7 Months while \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up the weapon Meta again.Maybe they achieved to better out the game with new contend and new Ideas coming with each Season?They did somewhat. I mean they added 2 new exotic Activities to get an exotic weapon from. Now with random rolls and perks. So if you aren\u2019t happy with you EXOTIC WEAPON you need to grind and repeat an activity that is getting repetitive after 3 times.while talking about repetitive. This is the Vendor-thing of season 10https://ibb.co/bzXbSJC Here we have one of the 3 main Vendors of the new DLChttps://ibb.co/0Ff8kyf The main Vendor of season 12 in some smaller formhttps://ibb.co/ZdQP4zd the Artifact u need to unlock if you want any seasonal Gear (12) that is not gained randomizedhttps://ibb.co/Bt3M8ss and look what we got for the current season (14) again :Dhttps://ibb.co/gZVPHnV Of course they added a lot of weapons after they also struggled with this after Beyond Light and tbh, some of the are incredible fun. But hey, we got the 6 new rewards for one of the pinnacle activities of the game,\u201cNightfalls\u201d  all of them being old, recycled Destiny 1 weapons with 2 more incoming.The Raid added with the beginning of Season 14 is returning one from D1.The weapons added for one of the harder PvP modes, Iron Banner, in the last 4 seasons are 2 new designed and 8 being recycled back from the earlier days of this game.But I have to admit that it is pretty hard to come up with new content consistently for 4 years now, especially with a new season coming every 3-4 months. And its not like they didn\u2019t delivered content, we got a really good new raid, a slowly growing base of good and creative activities and a high new arsenal of powerful and just enjoyable weapons.I just personally feel like this game just isn\u2019t about the fun, the world itself anymore, the whole goal of players now is to get a high enough light-level to do something they did in the past season already, just to instantly start grinding for the next season\u2019s level-cap again.Most of the weapons youll find, will get dusted in your vault at some point.That all is why I really dont want to recommend this game anymore, it is just grinding in its purest form, and everything about this game has just got so repetitive.But to be honest the game might just have burnt me out on a personal level.There is one magical thing that survived all of Destiny\u2019s Lifetime and is the reason I am launching the game at certain days. The Community.The Community is what makes this game maybe so special. I met incredible people, made friendships and began to love the playerbase.

Even more so, when Bungie finally split with Activision which made me think at first that everything is going to be great from now on. I thought Shadowkeep was not just going to be a good DLC, but also a positive turning point for the series so I immediately bought the entire Season Pass bundle. But sadly Destiny has disappointed me much more than it has positively surprised meThe new Seasons just suck. The new \"content\" isnt content, let alone new content. You basically are just playing old stuff to earn old stuff with a few new things mixed in. Season Passes should ATLEAST come with a Strike, Crucible Map and a Gambit Map. Even that is such a bare minimum but instead we get to grind Bounties which is definitely the type of grind Ive been always looking for. The \"new content\" is either just a new horde mode or gear that they recycled from Destiny 1 and if they add actual new gear that also looks cool, it almost always is something from the Eververse. Taking for example with Shadowkeeps launch. We have the launch of a new raid: Garden of Salvation. A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D1. Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour, a new exotic weapon quest, some kinetic and energy weapons and god \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me. A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid. However, there is no ship, no sparrow and no ghost within this raid. Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass. And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell \"Harpers Shell\" can be purchased from EVERVERSE. Why wasnt any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity. Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie. If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season, dont hide it behind a Eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites. It shows that we have gone and earned them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like youve done before, certain high tier triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant. Why not have the Thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless, creates a sense of..........pride and accomplishment for doing so, rather then just an emblem. Before finishing this review I quickly just want to point out a few other things-Surprisingly small Trials pool with the armor being yet another reskin.-No ritual weapons.-Quite a lot of hackers-More error codes than you could humanly count-Still no vendor refresh.-This season is a bounty simulator, again.-Strikes are STILL useless after YEARS of feedback.-Another season without a raid with no word of how often we can expect them or even when we can expect the next one.-Eververse seems to get the most attention. Looks like the only balance bungie really cares about is the one for my bank account.-Just the general amount and quality of content is lacking.It honestly feels like Destiny 2 has been in a slow decline since they parted ways with Activision, because at that time they got someone to put pressure on them to make actual content. Wether the content was good or not, it was still content and not hours of Bounty grinding, which doesnt mean that I want them back because the Eververse is already bad enough.Edit: The new event \"Guardian Games\" is about deciding which Class is the best one, not by doing challenges that take skill and would be fun, but by boring bounty grinding.

There is only one other game I\u2019ve spent more time on.This game has given me some of the best gaming experiences I\u2019ve had and probably will keep doing so: doing the campaigns with friends, my first underleveled nightfall as a kinderguardian (read new player), being carried through the first weekend of Whisper (thanks Java), farming EP for Ikelos-SG, my first raid (thanks Mortais), making friends, sherpa-ing others, participating and failing the day 1 LW, getting LH, getting the Rivensbane seal, going blind into the dungeons on day 1 with friends, solo flawlessing all dungeons, getting a week one completion in the CoS and GoS raid, lowmanning Levi/EoW/CoS, earning Not Forgotten and the Unbroken seal, scrims, going flawless, forming a proper team to stay up all night and get the day 1 completion for both DSC and VoG\u2026With that all said, how could I not recommend others to start playing and \u2018become legend\u2019 too? The game is great, gunplay/music/areas amazing, loot and community mostly good.What\u2019s not to like?The badThe highest highs go paired with the lowest lows. Destiny 2 is hard to get into nowadays, don\u2019t be fooled by the F2P tag, the \u2018new light\u2019 (read new player) experience is bad and doesn\u2019t resemble the full experience in the slightest. There are a lot of unexplained mechanics, everything can feel overwhelming at first, and then at some point you probably realize that there\u2019s nothing left to do except grind strikes, crucible and gambit for the foreseeable future. Strikes turn stale fast, crucible is where new lights get extinguished and gambit is gambit. You might discover the Prophecy dungeon at some point, which might be a brick wall for some, but definitely fun for a couple clears. So what now?Wait, the F2P raid, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, Vault of Glass?! Well, first you have to grind all the way up from level 1100, to the soft-cap at 1270, grind powerful rewards for a couple weeks until you reach 1310-1320. All in all probably around 25-30 hours\u2019 worth of doing the same activities over and over. This isn\u2019t bad per se, but once you reach 1270 the grind slows down hard. As a new player back in 2018 I hated seeing my progression be time gated.Without any dlc to hold your hand, this will be a rough and boring grind. See edit, this no longer countsThe worstSo you\u2019ve made it through the entire grind, finished your first raid and are thinking about checking out the paid content.While the money/spent-time ratio is pretty decent imo, and the campaigns can help guide new players in a fun way, do be prepared to spend quite some money and time. Forsaken: 25\u20ac -> Shattered Throne + Last Wish raid Shadowkeep: 25\u20ac -> Pit of Heresy + Garden of Salvation raid Beyond Light: 40\u20ac -> Deep Stone Crypt raidWith upcoming: Anniversary Dungeon: 25\u20ac Witch Queen: 40\u20ac OR Witch Queen + 4 seasons + 2 dungeons: 80\u20acIn total you\u2019re looking at 80\u20ac for the current content and another 100\u20ac for upcoming. This alone can be a hard sell, so definitely don\u2019t buy everything at once, maybe check out Forsaken or Beyond Light, try a single season, buy only Witch Queen on 22feb. Do be warned though that content you paid for can and will disappear sometime in the future. The Forsaken campaign will leave in February. Previously we\u2019ve lost 3 campaigns, 2 dungeons and 5 raids.ConclusionI love the game and will keep playing it for the time being. But I can\u2019t recommend it to new players, because it\u2019s a mess.As a new light you\u2019ll need someone to hold your hand and even then it\u2019ll be rough. I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s worth it in the end, but odds are against you, I\u2019ve had way more friends give up on Destiny than get into it, currently sitting at 9 to 1.If you do decide to go for it, good luck, welcome to the community, join a clan, enjoy your firsts.", "Author": "Highfire", "Hours": 1633.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 1, 2019", "Review": "(Bungie fell from grace and added a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Battle Pass and have upped their microtransaction-game.)If I were to describe Destiny 2 in a single sentence it would be: repeat infinitely, achieve nothing.Destiny 2 will never allow you to feel powerful. No matter how much you play, you will always be as strong as everyone else. No matter how long you spend grinding bounties, how many raids you do and how many dungeons you do you will never feel like you achieved anything. Every gun, every piece of armor is so similar, the biggest difference between them is how they look. And to make matters worse, shotguns, snipers and other more powerful guns have so little ammo, that theres no point in using them. Its usually quicker to just kill the enemies with your main gun than to swap and take 5 shots with a somewhat better gun.For the same reasons you can only equip a single piece of exotic armor and  a single exotic weapon at once. Its not because theyre any good, but its because if you could actually equip some of those cool pieces of gear you spent a hundred hours getting you would feel like you achieved something. Exotic powers range from making you run a little faster, to throwing grenades a bit farther, to giving energy to people around you wearing the same exotic. On their own, theyre so weak, almost none of them are worth using. Its the same with guns. Some of them are actually good, but you can only equip one, so why bother grinding for more of them? Why bother doing the missions and challenges you paid for when they only give you a good gun you will never use? So few of the exotics are worth using, theres no point in grinding for them. (Most of them are random drops, so you cant actually even grind for them).Destiny 2 is a game for people who loves doing the same thing over and over again. \"Kill 10 Vex\" \"Kill 10 Vex on Mars\" \"Kill 10 Cabal on Nessus\" \"Go stand over there for a bit\" \"Do that dungeon again 3 times, but with harder enemies\". None of the missions give you anything good, anyways. Some glimmer and XP, and sometimes a gun or armor you will use for 5 minutes until you get one with a higher Power Level. Its a waste of time. Go play Borderlands 3 instead. It actually lets you feel a bit of the power and fun you grind for, and weapons are actually unique.", "Author": "\ud808\udd9cDarkWolf\ud808\udc16", "Hours": 60.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 11, 2020", "Review": "This game sucks, it\u2019s my favorite game.", "Author": "GODTRIDENT", "Hours": 1854.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: January 20", "Review": "This game could beat me up in a Tesco parking spot then charge me for the damages to its fists.Id probably still pay up.Highly recommended for addicts.", "Author": "Guakstick", "Hours": 3993.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 14, 2020", "Review": "---{Graphics}---\u2610 Eyegasm\u2611 Beautiful\u2610 Good\u2610 Decent\u2610 Meh\u2610 Tiger Electronics LCD Quality---{Gameplay}---\u2610 Very good\u2611 Good\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\u2610 Mehh\u2610 Dear lord save me---{Audio}---\u2611 Eargasm (stasis uwu)\u2610 Very good\u2610 Good\u2610 Not too bad\u2610 Bad\u2610 Earrape---{Audience}---\u2610 Kids\u2611 Teens\u2611 Adults\u2610 Human---{PC Requirements}---\u2610 Check if you can run paint\u2610 Potato\u2611 Decent\u2610 Fast\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulity}---\u2610 Just press A\u2018\u2610 Easy\u2611 Significant brain usage\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\u2610 Difficult\u2610 Dark Souls---{Grind}---\u2610 Nothing to grind\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\u2610 Average grind level\u2611 Too much grind\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding---{Game Time}---\u2610 Long enough for checking on your Tamagotchi\u2610 Short\u2610 Average\u2610 Long\u2611 To infinity and beyond ---{Price}---\u2611 It\u2019s free!\u2610 Worth the price\u2611 If u have some spare money left (DLC)\u2610 Not recommended\u2610 Thats cash in the trash---{Bugs}---\u2610 What bugs?\u2611 Minor bugs\u2610 Can get annoying\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\u2610 Sonic 06edit:this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game drain my life", "Author": "Beanut Budder", "Hours": 813.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: September 23, 2021", "Review": "So I bought D2 and the first two DLCs at launch way back in the day.

Well thats what it said.Story:You play as a so-called guardian who was chosen to protect the last city on earth together with other guardians from any kind of evil. This all happens in a sci-fi world where humanity has long ago been able to make great advances in technology and medicine through the arrival of a huge ... ball called the \"traveler\". The people on earth want to protect this, of course, but this also has a hell of an enemy ... the \"darkness\".But this should not be a story playthrough just a rough direction so you can imagine what its all about.Content:Quest in general are betweenbad / exhausting to very good and doing all is a thing I can highly recommend.The good thing here is that you dont have to do it. The planets are all very large (except mercury) and offer a lot of lost Sectors (mini dungeons),public events and secrets. The best are The Dreaming City and the Moon. Bungie has focused on creating a world that evolves. In the dreaming city, for example, there is a curse that worsens every week, provides for other activities, or makes new secrets associated with the lore. At the moment we have invasions on the moon that do not appear after the current season. All in all very well done. There are also strikes (dungeons) PvP (which I do not use in rating), gambit (PvP / PvE mode), Raids and proper dungeons (3-player raids). The dungeons are very good in my opinion.So this is an MMO, what is the Endgame ? The endgame of destiny is to min-max your gear and ... and ... um ... yes, here comes the problem. For Many destiny players the endgame is different and most of them simply do what makes them fun, there is no fixed endgame which for many is a big no go. For me, its farming triumphs and reading the lore. You can get triumph points by getting things in the game, there are triumph points for almost everything. Its like a mastery level showing how dedicated you are. In addition, there are titles that require you to do certain tasks in an area in the game. Then there are people who want to farm all the exotic weaponsetc. everything just stuff for completionists. Then there are the people who make challenges, solo raids or a dungeon solo flawless etc.Conclusion:So why a thumbs up from me ... well, I think Destiny is very good as a f2p game and that the DLCs are worth every penny. Its fun to play with friends, and for anyone who can spend lots of time in games and have no problem finding an active community to raid, it will be a long time to enjoy the game. ^^PS:The lore from destiny is by far the best i know. I fell in love with it and can recommend it to everyone else. You can read lore in game by finding the lore books on the triumph page.

The Good -Solid gunplay, interesting enemies, excellent teamplay. This game understandably feels like halo, and thats a great thing. Good team interactions, cooperation, great boss fights and core gameplay loop of shoot-to-loot. Armor and customization is through the roof, and you really can play how you want. Great art, music, landscapes, the game is beautiful and runs well. It rewards consistent fighting and it makes you really feel like youre part of a war effort, and theres always something to do. The voice acting, story, characters are all excellent, and its easy to get hooked into being a Guardian, its really a game that rewards player retention.The Not-Good -Content removals, nerfs, paywalls and FOMOFrom the moment you begin the new player experience, youre hit with a brick wall of FOMO, references are made to crucially lore-important events, wars, and showdowns youve never heard of (or be able to play), players wearing armors, holding titles, and wielding weapons youll never be able to get, because theyve been simply removed from the game. Sunsettings mean that items, cosmetics, etc. that you cant buy from the MTX store (which does stock *some* past things, but nothing gameplay-impacting or particularly prestigious) are gone for good, and you had to be there. Better luck next time. The game is advertised as free, but the main meat of the game (since the games story campaign has been removed) is found in DLC content... a lot of it, which adds up in price. Throw in paid season passes, time-limited events, and the fact that bungie regularly makes balance changes with the intent to shake up the meta, requiring you to re-grind the metagame gear, means that if you miss playing for long enough, youll be set back tremendously.  Less so with the weekly bounties/vendor rotations, but if you cant play for a week, and said vendors have a currently meta or crucially important item, well, better luck next time. This is to speak nothing of the RNG involved in drop farming, but thats pretty well covered in some of the other reviews.  EDIT: Shortly after releasing this review, bungie announced they were vaulting Forsaken, the much beloved cayde-6 expansion- a DLC paid for with real money \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afThis is the only AAA game that ive ever heard of that releases anti-updates, where the game *loses* content you paid for and replaces it with something new that you have to pay for, again.Summary/TL;DR-Its good, if youre willing to start permanently behind and not mind the business model.To enjoy this game in full, you needed to have been playing at launch, or even D1 before it, but its still decently fun to get into and frag around in. If you really want to reach popular or endgame content or *truly* shine and join a high level clan (one of the only ways to do said high level content), be prepared for weekly grinds, RNG slogs, and the need to devote a significant portion of your life to keeping tabs on this game to stay relevant and obtain good rolls on things before the meta eventually shifts.

If you just play until there\u2019s no story left and leave, then you really haven\u2019t gotten into the part of the game Bungie intended as the core experience. Frankly, I can\u2019t blame anyone for doing that, as Bungie does a piss-poor job at explaining exactly what to do for inexperienced players (or even me, someone who has over 5,000 hours in this series). When it comes down to it, the game is free now, so the only risk you have trying this out is some download time. There are MANY potentially enjoyable experiences in this game. It\u2019s up to you to determine if any of them are for you. Do yourself a favor and look for some people willing to sherpa you through the content you don\u2019t understand or simply look it up.[Also, beware of some reviews on here. Armor customization IS free and people aren\u2019t patient enough to unlock it like normal people. There is absolutely no incentive to buy armor due to grinding because armor you buy has no actual power unless you already have powerful armor that you then infuse said armor in to. The armor system does EXACTLY what they said it would do and there\u2019s no denying that. There is, unfortunately, a group of people who continue to say the opposite because they must point their finger at some random thing they make up because they aren\u2019t qualified to put their thoughts to words.

Considering I can spend \u00a320 on another game and get 1000 hours out of it (looking at you Valhiem) why would I spend the same amount to get access to a single campaign that I will most likely finish in about 10-12 hours? And the worst part is, the Destiny fanbois will continue to support this, they will continue to fork out hundreds of pounds just to get access to a few new maps or items, its ridiculous. So, even though I have several hundreds hours in this game, i would not recommend it.

But a lot of the replayability comes from an ABSURD grind, not only for your power level but in getting good rolls of weapons. The game is a timesinkm, but playing with friends can make it feel like much less of a slog and overall helps the experience.The Gameplay LoopAs I said before, Destiny 2s essential gameplay loop is redoing the same activities in hopes of getting better loot, at certain points you start getting minor increases because youve reached one of the caps of the game. There are 3 that increase every season, soft cap (literally every loot drop you get will progress you towards this), powerful cap (only powerful rewards, listed on the map will progress you towards this) and pinnacle cap (the most tedious part of the loop and will absolutely be where most of the enjoyment/frustration is coming in). Pinnacle Rewards come from pinnacle activities such as grandmaster nightfalls, the most recent raid, and dungeons; you can also get them from doing the matchmade activities a few times with certain conditions. But what happens when you hit the pinnacle cap? Thats when you start looking for god rolls of weapons, perk combinations that benefit the build you have. Want to spam grenades? Look for demolitionist on a weapon and high discipline armor pieces, etc. The build variety is quite large although some mods are more useful than others which will become apparent the more you play.The EndgameThe pinnacle activities are going to be where you want to be spending a lot of your time, and whilst the rewards for a lot of them are locked out on a weekly basis, the enjoyment isnt. These are the only real challenge that the game has to offer and building a team to tackle them is necessary in some situation and highly recommended in others. Raids become pretty stale at some point because youll have them down to a routine especially if youre playing with the same set of people (which is recommended to avoid using the god awful PC lfg server). \"But what does this grind amount to?\" Itll prepare you for the true peak of endgame, Grandmaster Nightfalls; this is the hardest activity* in the game and provides the highest chance of getting the best upgrade material and gear rarity, exotics. You can get them throughout the game but these are the best way to farm for good rolls on the armor pieces, and trust me youll want good rolls for a lot of these. * constantly availableThere is one more thing Id like to address regarding the endgame, and its the most prestigious part and what a lot of streamers are working towards; the day one raid race. Every year, the day the new raid goes live, everyone has 24 hours where the raid is power capped. This means that regardless of your power level, you will always be 20 power below the recommended for each encounter, which puts you at a huge disadvantage. But its worth it, because the team that clears it first gets acknowledgement by the developers, as well as given a raid belt. A huge WWE style belt that shows off your achievement. And for those that dont get the first clear, clearing it within the first 24 hours grants you an emblem to flex your achievement ingame. This is the single most time consuming activity in the game, my team took 9 hours to clear Deep Stone Crypt, the current most recent raid as of the time of writing this review, but the satisfaction at the end was godly. This should be everyones goal, but make sure you dont burn yourself out preparing for this, Find a clan, make some friends, and get a dedicated team prepared. Set up your loadout, farm your god rolls and be ready to face the ultimate challenge.PVP and PVEVPThroughout this review I tried to ignore two aspects of the game: the Crucible, the pvp mode where you can assert dominance over other players in combat, and Gambit, where you compete with an enemy team in killing enemies to see who can kill enemies the fastest. Gambit can be enjoyable if youre more used to the PVE side of the game because you only occasionally deal with an enemy player ruining your day, the Crucible however is a pure competitive dumpster fire. If your aim is true and youre confident in your skill, give the Crucible and its pinnacle mode, the Trials of Osiris, a try. Neither of these modes are my fort\u00e9 which is why Ive avoided talking about them, I dont enjoy either and only do Trials occasionally when the low win rewards are worth getting to assist in PVE.

Upon release me and a bunch of friends got this game for its 70 euro price tag, as much as i hate the price tag AAA games have nowadays this game did in no way dissapoint. Here i also want to mention this is not a perfect timeline and the issues i encountered were only from maybe 20 percent of the total time the game was released as i played on and off leaving gaps easily the size of semesters.The campaign while relatively short was amazing, the music, the storytelling, the characters aswell made the short experience one of my favourites for sure.The pvp was fun and the specials events such as trials of the nine were a worthwhile challenge giving you exclusive rewards.Pve is where this game really shines, many strikes were available, short action packed adventures always ending in a bossfight. The best part of the game was the raid however for me, a co-op experience unparalleled. For a decent period this game was nearly perfect.After a while it was really noticable that there were updates with new armor sets, vehicles and other items added, this was the first struggle as they were behind a paywall leaving the non micro-transaction fan emptyhanded for months up to years. Upon release you were able to enjoy all the new content as you got your generic lootboxes filled with these items as rewards for playing. This after i presume the sales dropped with time and the dosh was collected the fountain spouting new content in the form of new items remained but attaining it without paying got treated as if it was a bug and got patched out.Dlc was introduced with curse of osiris, after a short afternoon my plate was licked clean and whilst I enjoyed the content it was extremely shortlived for the most part. There was a raid added aswell but this one passed by rather lackluster with only a single stage being near the same level as even the least noteworthy one of the original leviathan raid.As we let the years pass the now 70 euro game with 40 euros of dlc becomes free to play hooray !! There was a lot of commotion towards bungies contract with activison as the community thought was activision pulling some strings making bungie look bad so lets hope whatever issues there were lets hope theyll dissapear.As new dlc was introduced it started a new cycle where all previous content gets stashed away in their vault presumable to be maybe polished up and reintroduced. It sounds nice but it strips the game barren except for the latest release of dlc. If you dont participate and buy new content  every so often dont expect to enjoy the raggedy collection of activities disconnected from every other fragment of the game. I, someone who bought the main game am affected by it because all base game content has been put on the shelf but also everyone who bought any of the dlc shares the same experience. The main game review mention very little of this but a quick glance at the reviews of the dlc will show how people have been buying content just to have it replaced for new buyable content. As long bungie keeps this \"the game would toooootally be too big for anyone to handle so well just take the whole thing of your hands\" act up im afraid things wont change. Other games like the master chief collection have shown games can have large on the go interchangable dlc among the sizes destiny would have and at the same time pose no issue to any part of the game. However  Bungies motive has been clear and clarified further through their perpetual charade of non issues posing threats to the game.moving on some more years. The game has been stripped of any content except for 3 zones that were a part of the original game resulting in still having to buy the current dlc for an experience uncomparable to what the base game is. More than that all gear gained from pvp events such as trials of the nine or raidgear that is not attainable anymore have been nearly completely removed. Now if you want to get anything near the likings of what years of playing got you you better pay up because all content worth playing is behind a paywall because the rest has been removed because of imaginary restrictions easily fixed by features steam has had for many years. A pity excuse to strip the game naked of any content enjoyable by the f2p player or returning players. A decent chunk of the community have shared their experiences just to met with people happily paying copious amounts of money to satisfy bungies micro transaction endeavours and dlc constraints, swatting away any complaints towards bungie justifying their actions often almost getting of to the near abusive relation bungie has with their playerbase.What i fear most is that bungie will find a way to resell the base game at a later date as dlc, not an unlikely situation even if they continue this.If the game ever stops hoarding the content and starts utilising steams dlc feature or if the game regains the red war campaign and the leviathan raid and the rest of the vanilla content, reccomending this game will be the biggest no brainer as of yet providing one of the best experiences available espescially as a f2p game. Until then, i cant reccomend new players to waste any time on the current version of the game just as i cant reccomend returning players to pain themselves with how deliberately inaccessible this game is for non dlc buying returning players.thanks", "Author": "pas snic", "Hours": 114.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: February 7", "Review": "I have spent an ungodly amount of time on this game.

I like to consider myself a calm and collected human being but after i play a match of trials its as if I have the overwhelming feeling to know what a shotgun shell taste like. The only thing that makes the pvp so bad in this game is the developers have no concept of matchmaking and the communities incessant need to gate keep the tower. One match you will feel like the people you are playing against are about your skill level. The next match, and every match after that, you will be matched with people that have not seen the sunlight since their mom drove them home from the hospital from their birth. If there was an exotic quest for going outside I think they would be incapable of such a feat just due to the fact they cannot get out of their chair, have you seen the south park episode where they play WoW, that is them. The only redeeming quality this game does have is blind running a dungeon and or raid.

There is a semi functional modding system for armour, and theyre on their way to patching a semi functional class system with stasis and void 3.0.So why is this review negative? Because at this point the bad outweighs the good. The \"semi playable state\" of the game came at the expense of removing about half the games content. Including weapons/destinations/planets/pvp maps/gambit maps/strikes.This includes content people had paid and worked for. The entire red war from the base game is removed and unplayable, (Worth 60$ on release), Curse of Osiris has been removed (17$), and so has Warmind (20$), and so has forsaken (40$). All this content people paid for has been removed from the game by bungie with no compensation or anything of the sort.As if that wasnt enough all weapons from these expansions have also been \"sunset\" having their light level locked rendering them essentially useless in any sort of meaningful content. A lot of these weapons people grinded for days if not weeks. One of my personal favourites was the breakneck, the gambit pinnacle weapon that required hundreds of matches to get, has been essentially castrated and rendered unusable anywhere outside the tutorial. Ok. Why? The weapon was already underpowered, it never defined the meta or broke anything, but for some reason bungie saw fit to functionally remove it alongside hundreds of other weapons that people worked their asses off to get.A lot of people have said good things about witch queen, and Im sure its a decent expansion, but Im sorry, Shadowkeep was a scam, Beyond Light was a 20$ DLC that they charged 40$ for, and now theyre again charging 40$ for witch queen, 10$ for the season (I.e. 10$ extra for any sort of content after the 5 hour campaign) plus 20$ for the other two seasons of the year, plus extra for dungeons that used to be packaged with the season, ontop of the microtransactions, ontop of the anniversary dlc that locked the most famous weapon from destiny 1s history behind a paywall (Gjallarhorn). What kind of company monetizes their own anniversary so cynically lmaoBy the way, the cheapest cosmetic costs 600 silver, and the cheapest silver package you can buy is 500 for 5$, this is definitely a company that cares for its customers.And this is just getting into the meta issues of the game. Because the game itself still has several more. Mechanics like \"champions\" that are unkillable unless you use the proper seasonal mods force you into using weapons that match this seasons artifact mods even if you dont like using them. Matchgame that renders huge chunks of weapons unusable unless they have the right element because they cant break the matched shieldsArmour affinity that serves no purpose other than to make you grind 4 seperate versions of each piece (ignoring stats) just to be able to use mods, or spend about 500 cores to upgrade one set to level 10 letting you swap for free (which should be default anyway.)Theres a very solid core gameplay loop because the gunplay is good and the abilities are fun (You know, when theyre not on 10 minute long cooldowns, I am not joking, the ultimates are literally on 10 minute long cooldowns), but everything surrounding it is just an unmitigated disaster of unbelievable proportions.Especially the buildcraft system. To make builds you upgrade your armour to give it more capacity and slot mods into it that grant you various abilities and combat benefits, sounds good so far, the problem? The only way to get those mods is from a vendor called ada that brings a random set of 4 every day. Yep. The entire buildcraft system is gated behind RNG and there are multiple build defining mods that havent shown up in months. Have fun and remember to pray for her to bring the specific mod you need for your build.So, tl;dr, Yeah the game is certainly *playable*, but theres no content to actually play.

Another game geared towards team play and coordination.Story\ud83d\udd39Is executed similarly to TV series. While the whole game follows a general idea and set of events, each campaign tells a new and full-fledged story of its own but also chained to the main setting. Guardians are fighting to re-establish humanity\u2019s foothold on key outposts on Earth and other planets. Meanwhile, armies of an alien race known as the Cabals attack the Last City and the Traveler. They strip all Guardians of their Lights, the energy that powers them.

Campaigns aside, there are countless activities to take on with a fireteam up to six players. Raids and Dungeons are in the bigger league of activities. They are challenging coop missions and require communication between players to succeed. They involve specific quests for groups of fireteams.\ud83d\udd39Smaller activities are also considered for those who just like to shoot stuff without frying their brains. Strikes are small missions loosely tied to the story. Flashpoints work as random \"Holdout\" styled events in free-roam. Moreover, weekly and daily bounties are a good way to jump in and get yourself some gear and materials.PvP\ud83d\udd39Is a bit more of a mixed bag. if youre looking for a highly competitive experience, you should probably look elsewhere. The Crucible is at times incredibly frustrating. It consists of many common multiplayer modes like search & destroy, TDM, and kill confirmed. Gambit, on the other hand, is a unique experience that you can\u2019t replicate anywhere else. A PvPvE mode that throws two fireteams in separate arenas, but fighting for the same goal. Banking points to reach the boss fight while the enemy team sends out members through portals to slow their rivals progress.Weapons & Armors\ud83d\udd39The item rarities range from common through uncommon up to rare and legendary with Exotic being the highest rank. Most of the items under the same type share similar stats, so what makes the grind for them valid and reasonable?

I never played any of the Destiny series, nor have I really watched any videos. Somehow I managed to avoid understanding what this game is for nearly a decade. So this review is for the newbies like me.Anyway, I thought Id give it a try since its free. Turns out its a lot of fun! At least, 25 hours in its still a lot of fun. Its an interesting mix between looter shooter and MMO. Think Borderlands 3 meets Guild Wars 2 or something. The weapons are all sorts of crazy looking and there are a lot of \"exotic\" weapons to collect through quests and grinds. The shooting feels really good in my opinion, this is definitely a fast paced game that encourages staying on your toes. You also have a multitude of subclass abilities that you unlock and improve over time that make the fighting even more dynamic. Like seriously, this is the first MMO Ive played that feels like a proper FPS.You basically jump from planet to planet completing quests, bounties (rep grinds), strikes (dungeons), gambits (PvPvE), Crucibles (PVP), and other activities. There are often public activities that you can just hop in on at any time and help with. The loot system is honestly confusing at first, and the power levels seem pretty arbitrary. Basically, dont spend too many resources upgrading things until everything you own is power level 1200. Except Exotic gear, since that stuff is the good stuff. Also theres not much point in running around looking for loot, youll get all the good stuff from killing things and doing quests/bounties.The story is honestly kind of meh in my opinion. None of the characters or lore really reel me in, so I cant talk too much about that. I really just like shooting things, its fun.The graphics are stunning. I love the sheer scale of some of the environments and the attention to detail that has gone into them. The frozen moon Europa has some of the coolest set dressing in my opinion. The colors are vibrant and there are quite a few areas that can look almost photo-realistic. The HDR implementation is JANKY, but works well once you figure out how to configure it properly (its worth a google). I have an RTX 3080 and I can almost max this game out at 4k/120fps in most areas (with 3D AO disabled). Anyway, for free, I highly recommend giving it a try. If you enjoy it and run out of activities, maybe purchase one expansion at a time. My only concern is that Im just starting to see how this game can get grindy once you finish the main content.

The gunplay? Great. The abilities? Smooth. The game is really fluid at its best, and absolutely an experience everyone should try. Who is this game best for? People who wont devote their free time to it. People who will pick the game up and put it down every so often. On the casual front, Destiny 2 has a lot of content, especially for new players. There are entire campaigns (you will need to talk to an NPC to activate the story mode, its kind of hidden?) to play through, a lot of activities to run through countless times until you get bored, and a lot of flavors of gear to farm for, both guaranteed and RNG-based. If you are in no rush, Destiny 2 is an amazing game. For the majority of activities in this game that arent \"end-game\" or really hard, you can also use any loadout you could dream of. Any subclass, any gun, any armor, etc. Just because it feels good, you can use it. Thats the part of Destiny 2 I loved the most when I started. The PvP is fun at a base level, and even lesser-skilled FPS players should have a good time, because thanks to the games mechanics, aiming is very generous. Even if you think your aim is bad, give PvP a try for a few rounds. Youll find yourself doing a lot better than youd expect yourself to once youre more used to the movement in this game. On the dedicated \"hardcore\" front, Destiny 2 has a lot of time sinks that will absolutely burn you out if you try too hard. Ive farmed basically every farmable gun the game has to offer for a great roll, Ive done every raid bar 2 of the smaller ones, and gotten the past 3 titles (Flawless, Savior, and Almighty). The game devolves really hard once the initial allure runs out. Once it stops feeling super satisfying or badass to blow up a gigantic world-ending robot for your 13th time, the game starts devolving into a chore. The activities you farm for your loot are very slow paced and generally boring, farming god rolls is NOT generous at all, farming for power levels becomes an absolute slog, and overall the rewarding aspects of the game fade away once you get all the initial loot the game has to offer. You also lose the ability to play the way you want with the armor, subclasses, and weapons you like if you want to complete end-game in reasonable time. Raids almost demand very specific loadouts (high dps loadouts rather), and a lot of guns in the game dont fit that bar. Raids become very bland since they dont change, PvP becomes very bland for a few reasons. The main one is that not all guns are created equally. A lot of the best feeling guns in the game perform terribly in PvP because they cannot compete with the current meta, even if youre an absolute top tier player, its apparent that your performance drops thanks to using a \"bad\" gun. Another big reason Skill Based Match Making (SBMM for short) and Peer to Peer connections (P2P for short), leading you to connecting with people across the world in favor of close by thanks to \"skill equalization\" and having to play through other players connections rather than a dedicated server, which leads to frustrating gameplay that you stop enjoying after a while. Another reason is balance. I love PvP still, but when I perform well and the strong majority of my deaths/losses are to a very weak balance team, it becomes way less fun than a game should be. I highly suggest you try Destiny 2 if youre on the fence, but I also suggest you avoid getting hardcore with it. Treat it like a game, not a chore. You can miss out on content and gear without losing much in the long run. Like all good things, moderation is key in ensuring Destiny 2 stays good for you.

Putting in 2 hours a week is like watching the Lord of the Rings in 10-minute intervals. RNG gear grind is the definition of what you spend most of your time on. Is kind of bland when playing alone unless youre really good at making friends online. Matchmaking for missions puts you together with people speed running for farm, so youre always playing catch-up and not really enjoying the activity itself. Theres over 500 weapons and about 450 of them are completely useless in comparison to the top 50 which are really hard to get (top of my head, not exact numbers). Having the best gear for one area (PvP, PvE, PvPvE) requires you to invest a lot of time in all other areas. Some of the best PvE weapons are rewarded for reaching the highest PvP ranks. PvP will eventually most likely disgust you if youre not into high TTK FPS. Average weapon TTK for Destiny is 1160 ms. For reference, latest Call of Duty is 277 ms. PvP doesnt have the best netcode Ive seen. Half of all melee kills are trade kills where you slap each other to death at the same time. Hits register as headhosts when my aim is ridiculously off target etc. (EDIT: as of Season of the Worthy, automatic weapons received a buff in PvP, so this point does not apply anymore)In current meta, out of the top 100 weapons ordered by kills in competitive PvP, only 15 are fully automatic. And the highest ranking one is on the 19th position - if you like automatic weapons and hate snipers like me, you will statistically have a bad time over 80% of the time. Top tier PvP is about knowing everything there is to know (kind of like DOTA) and owning everything there is to own (hence the endless gear grind). Theres a LOT of both. Ive played over 300 hours - not even close in either category (maybe you can do it much faster though, Im not the smartest when it comes to learning top tier meta games). The illusion of friendly non-toxic community dissolves once you enter ranked PvP in any form. Balance changes introduced in one season, these exact changes reverted in the next - Bungie sometimes dont seem to know what theyre doing balance-wise. Speaking of balance, there are 3 player classes: Hunter, Titan, Warlock. Their usage ratio in PvP in that order is circa 21:12:13 (based on my 4.344 kills, not the biggest sample but large enough to be statistically significant). Although, nobody appears to see this as a problem, I think the numbers are worth pointing out.

There are many clues spread around all these different places, whether its a quote, or a quest or a weapon backstory, or even the NPCs randomly rambling while being AFK, it adds one more layer of complexity to the mysterious nature of the narrative and the grand scheme being orchestrated by other-wordly powers.The equipment system is really vast, making room for some amazing builds that can be totally overkill if you invest in some time and creativity, many guns have their unique set of traits that just bring something new to the table therefore allowing you to switch your gameplay style in any way you like, if you want a fusion rifle that melts everything in its path or a light machine gun that sends lightning from the sky, anyone can find a weapon for their taste. And dont get me started on the armor system. It is so rich that if i were to start talking about the mods this review would never end, and it already is long enough, i still have plenty more to cover.The amount of content available in this game rivals that of many other games Ive played, there are just so many things you can do. You can perfect yourself in PvP or gang up with 5 friends and tackle an ancient dragon, then go inside it and destroy its heart. Or just try to finish every quest there is, it is up to you.CONS:This game is a blast at the beginning, but once you start doing the quests and the higher-tier activities such as dungeons and flawless raids you eventually run out of things to do, and so you lack purpose having to buy a pretty pricey DLC to get something to work on, and then you might get to the point where you finish every campaign and every quest and all of the content on all DLCs and every bit of seasonal content and so you have nothing left to do, sure you can try to do a dungeon all by yourself without dying once but eventually you will burn out.The layout of the power system and quests is repetitive. And what I mean by that is that every season there are new activities right? But you arent strong enough so you just have to level up, and that process of leveling up just gets boring at one point. Farm that thing X times then do 30 bounties then play some multiplayer matches and thats it! Over and over again. With the quests we can see the same problem. Go to this place and kill that thing X times, go in X game mode and kill X things. And sometimes quests can be so PAINFULLY LONG AND SLOW that you might end up just giving up.Another issue I have is that there are only specific places where you can get a certain piece of gear such as a shiny new exotic weapon that rivals every other weapon, or some special armor and mods, and some people just cant acquire them! A lot of top tier gear comes from raids and dungeons, those being GROUP activities however there are some people that just dont have someone to play with, and so they have to struggle with their mediocre arsenal, never standing a chance against someone that has those top tier builds when running into them in PvP.The upgrade system is a pain when reaching the final levels, maxing out a piece of armor requires a lot of expensive materials that are so hard to come by so that you just have to grind your ass off just to get that masterwork exotic piece of armor ( I have 500 hours in game and have only one piece of maxed out armor!)And that would be pretty much it, even though the game has its flaws and there are quite a few of them, its a really fun game that can be challenging at times and therefore I recommend this game to anyone that has the PC to play it.

On one hand, you have a beautiful game with a great soundtrack, satisfying gunplay, amazing raid and mission-style activities (like the Last Wish raid and the currently-in-rotation Presage mission, though I put Last Wish as the best Destiny 2 can offer), and a respectable amount of guns, abilities, and mods to play around with. On the other hand, you have a game that was forced to remove a crapton of content, a lot of it good, for the sake of hard drive space and development time; you also have a game that, once you become more enthralled with it, is kinda shallow for the more hardcore audience. The game now works in $10 USD, 3 month-long seasons with bigger paid DLCs towards the end of the year, and for ten bucks you get a decent amount of stuff. Thing is, that content wears its welcome quite fast and you will most likely find yourself without a notion of what to do come the 3rd or 4th week into a season; this is more a result of a dripfeed system than lack of enjoyment. The power-leveling grind, which is the main grind in D2, gets old, really, really fast. It is a \"number go up\" type system, where the only reason to get to the highest level is to do Grandmaster difficulty strikes, which are not rewarding at all time investment-wise save for a player title. For anyone looking to do PvP or solely PvP, just dont play this game right now. A new player subclass, called Stasis, has sucked any and all fun that was left in PvP, which was not much, because it is a subclass that freezes you in place with no real counter or ability to fight back. It is the opposite of fun; the crappy endgame PvP experience (cheaters, system that only rewards absolute perfection, STASIS F**K, etc.) doesnt help either. All of this sounds negative, but the game still has a lot to offer you as a player, but dont expect perfection in the FPS MMO looter shooter genre, especially in this game.TL;DR, the game has its fair share of issues when it comes to hardcore, endgame-focused players, and has little to offer for the PvP crowd, but besides this and some iffy monetization practices (just look up Eververse and transmog for this game and youll see), I feel that this game is on the whole very addictive and fun to play with a group of friends, or even solo. FYI, this is NOT a F2P game. The F2P is moreso a trial with free events every other season or so, whereas all the actual content is paid. Its more like a World of Warcraft subscription system but less expensive, sorta.", "Author": "Oldmoney", "Hours": 751.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 2, 2019", "Review": "As of writing this review, I have played approximately 1600 hours of Destiny 2 over on Battle.net, where the game was previously hosted before moving to Steam.Destiny 2 is an interesting game, an instanced MMOFPS which certainly isnt a common sight. Just some quick history first, I picked up Destiny 2 upon release back in September 2017. I had not played Destiny 1 over on consoles so this was my first contact with a Bungie game since Halo: Reach. Both Destiny and Destiny 2 had issues in development apparently and Destiny 2 released in a subpar state, at least according to Destiny 2 veterans. Personally, I thought it was fantastic at the time and enjoyed Destiny 2s first year despite the extremely negative reception. Since then, there have been three major DLCs, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and the year two annual pass containing three minor DLCs, Black Armoury, Jokers Wild and Penumbra. As Destiny 2 enters its third year, the game is transitioning to a free to play model alongside its fourth major DLC, Shadowkeep.So right off the bat, I want to praise Bungie in their slick gameplay. Halo was renowned for its great gunplay and despite the Halo series being over for a while (games after Reach dont count), Bungie clearly have shown they still have it through Destiny. Destinys core gameplay of shooting dudes feels fantastic in pretty much every way, from the way the guns handle to the way the enemies move and react. All the guns feel and sound very satisfying, and enemies over the four enemy species are varied enough to change things up pretty frequently. This makes the in the moment gameplay just feel far better than most games I play. Speaking of sound, Destiny really excels at sound design. The music of Destiny is amazing and really shines in things like the story, dungeons and raids. Notable tracks like Journey or The Hunted just really set the mood perfectly and show that although Bungie no longer has Marty, they can still creat exceptional soundtracks. Sound effects are in the same boat, the musical cue of the Leviathans castellum doors opening, the telltale \"ting\" of Caluss chalice being shot or the boom of his thunderous claps, the crunch of the killing blow on a cursed thrall, the crack of a golden gun activation, I could go on and on. Theres so many sound effects in this game that just feel right and it makes the game so much better.Onto art direction and graphics, Destiny just looks beautiful honestly. The graphical fidelity might not be quite as high resolution as 2019 titles, but you dont notice it even staring at rocks up close. The direction is incredibly varied, from the forested ruins of the EDZ to the geometrical, artificial terrain of Nessus to the fantastical cliffs of the Dreaming City. Each location has a clear direction and pursues it to the fullest, all the way down to the organic hive infested tunnels on Mars or the dark, eerie depths of the Ascendant Plane. Even the skyboxes are great to look at, and I frequently find myself just watching the clouds roll over the lakes of the EDZ or the spaceship traffic in the tower in the Last City. In short, the art direction is stunning and Bungie does not shy away from ambitious vistas in this game.Destiny 2s looting looting and gear aspects are pretty simple. There are five tiers of weapons; common (white), uncommon (green), rare (blue), legendary (purple) and exotic (yellow). In contrast to most games, these classications arent indicative of rarity, instead at low light levels (weighted average of equipped gear levels) commons and uncommons drop, but at high levels commons and uncommons become impossible to drop and most of drops are rare, with the rest being legendary and sometimes exotics. Only legendary and exotic gear is really viable in any way, all other tiers are just for levelling or infusing (levelling up) the legendaries and exotics you like. Speaking of exotics, you can only equip one exotic weapon and one exotic armour piece at once, but they generally change your playstyle with completely new gamechanging perks. Levelling generally consists of doing any activity, raising you light level with random drops until you hit the soft cap, then doing specific activities that reward powerful gear until you hit the hard cap. This is then exceeded to an extent by using the artifact. Both the soft and hard caps increase with each season, as does the level requirement of new activities. Most activities are locked behind light level requirements, but since new players start at 750 now, this is irrelevant. Theres a huge amount of activities in the game at this point so it can cater to anyone. Year one story campaigns (Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind) are somewhat lower quality compared to newer content but are a good start. Theres a good amount of PvP variety if youre into that and a very large endgame with plenty of room for gear improvement.In terms of the endgame, Destiny 2 has quite a lot. Most prominently is the raids, of which there are seven at time of writing. The three year one Leviathan raids are available to everyone, the others need the relevant DLC. The raids are long, six man activities that are heavy on interesting mechanics and both individual and team skill expression. Theyre all an absolute blast to play through; if youre feeling up for it, doing them completely blind and figuring everything out on your own is much more fun than looking up mechanics and encounters. Performance in Destiny is heavily based on gear, so playing through specific activities to get good perks on your armour and weapons can take some time but gives you a huge edge or can be an endgame itself if youre so inclined. There are also dungeons like the Shattered Throne, which are shorter three man raids, which can be fun to explore and challenging to play. Or maybe you want to climb in competitive PvP or PvPvE. Theres even a speedrunning community if thats your style. Grabbing a bunch of friends to play through the endgame stuff is recommended, or you could find a clan that suits you or just LFG for raid groups but experiences may vary wildly.Destiny 2 is great in its current state, the best its been in fact, but I do have some complaints, albeit somewhat minor. Transparency is one thing, with the game insisting on using vague terminology when it comes to stats, leaving the community to have to extensively test what the descriptions actually mean. It would be great if the game used numbers more to help players into deciding what gear and mods to use. Some gear farming oriented activities like the Menagerie are somewhat stingy in the amount of loot dropped for the time investment. It would be nice to have more control over activities you play, for example there is no way to launch a specific private strike, and story mission replays are on a daily rotation. Some exotics are underwhelming and not worth the slot in any way (such as Oathkeepers) and some legendaries perform better than many exotics (like the Recluse). Crucible balance is quite poor too, with Bungie reacting extremely slowly to balance it when something becomes overpowered unexpectedly. Subclass diversity is also somewhat lacking compared to D1, it would be nice to get proper skill choices and trees.The new player experience has changed significantly with the F2P transition, with D1s intro mission being remade and added to contextualise things. New players also start at 750 light level which is good if you want to jump into endgame stuff, but kinda sucks for a sense of progression and challenge in my opinion. Year one raids are trivial at 750 light for example and the red war campaign would be a pushover. Regardless, new players have access to more than ever so I would highly recommend getting a few friends together and trying out the game.

Ive never played D1. Hell, I picked up this game during Forsaken. I didnt have anything to compare the game to, yet, the game was enjoyable and fun to play. Bungie showed us what they were capable of through Forsaken and Black Armory. The rest of the year wasnt as smooth as it was, but I still had high hopes when the game came to Steam. Out of grasp from a mainstream publisher, I truly hoped the game to actually take a positive turn.Then came Shaowkeep. An expansion that was supposed to be on-par with Forsaken. What did we get? Reskins. Reskinned armor, reskinned weapons, reskinned enemies. It was truly a season of reskins, but that wasnt all; the new season level system was designed in a way to bait new players into spending money in the game, for quite generous sum of resources. I hate this system, but I saw it as a \"neccessary evil\" since the game just went free. it wasnt a complete trainwreck yet. Armor 2.0 was overall a positive change. Nothing went worse, it just wasnt up to our expectations and standards. We could live with it, so we did.Then came season of Dawn. No new content, just more lore. Season activity? Discounted Menagerie(from 2 seasons back) with extra complications that limit your choice of arsenal. Like I said, I never played D1, but I caught up with the entire lore at this point, so I could appreciate the lore with Saint-14 an all, but that wasnt all that the season had. Bugs. Oh, the bugs. Not just any bugs that interfere with the gameplay, horrendously broken bugs that completely destroy the gameplay mechanic from bottom up. Then Bungie managed to nuke the servers data with what was supposed to be a bugfix too. And yet, they were at least trying to fix the bugs. The entire process was awful, but I still had hope for it yet.And now, comes the season of Worthy. Nerfs after another. Half of the entire changelog is nerfs, but thats not the important part. Warlock skating. Warlock skating has been a thing since the launch of D2. It was never intended to be, but it wasnt a problematic thing either, because the specific conditions required for it limited the use away from competition, and were more of a fun thing(unlike Titan skating). Skate out of the map, speedrun raids under 10 minutes, who cares? It required precise timing, positioning, and aiming with a specific weapon on a specific class, so it was accepted by the playerbase as a technique. Sure it breaks the immersion and all, but what does that matter to old players that have nothing new to explore in the game, and little bugs everywhere is ruining it anyways? Its but a game and all it mattered is that it was fun. So fun, in fact, that entire speedrunning community it built on top of breaking the map with warlocks. Frankly, it strangely felt right that Warlocks, the floaty space wizards, were the ones to break the game. Bungie took that from us. But did they reinforce the immersion? Some game-breaking bugs were still carried over from last season. Numerous holes in the maps you can literally walk up to on foot and fall out of the map? Still there. Raid mechanics breaking with specific abilities or weapons? Still there. Now, thats a lot of negatives up to this point, but what else did we get? Emblem rework. Some select emblems used to track your stats specific to the activity you get the emblem from. Bungie reworked the emblems so you have a wide range of stats for an emblem to track that you can select from. Sounds good on paper? Sure, major things could be selected like raid clears, but was it really worth sacrificing 80% of tracked stats that people were using, plus the sick halo over your head with some emblems? The direction was right, but execution was awful, and it took away all the character out of the emblems that actually gave you the incentive to choosing one. And thats not it, the seasonal content. Ive complained about bounties before and Ill do it again, but now this. This is just absurd. bounty after bounty, grind after grind, just to unlock a small feature youll never use? And this \"seasonal activity\" isnt even a reskin on a previous one, Its actually reusing whats already there, just with bigger numbers. There isnt even a small change, its literally the same activity, with bigger numbers. At this point, Bungie is just expecting the PvP side of their game carry their finances through. If they wanted their game to be exclusively casual PvP game, rather than story-driven or PvE teamwork driven, this is it. Bungie pulled away from Activision, and now theyre walking down the path of their old publishers mistakes.", "Author": "nobody", "Hours": 834.0}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: January 28", "Review": "Its not a game its a job", "Author": "JoeBidenLovesCuties", "Hours": 392.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: February 14", "Review": "Horrible Game", "Author": "Glow", "Hours": 5860.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: August 6, 2020", "Review": "Grind, Run out of content, Wait for new expansion, Grind again, Repeat.", "Author": "Diolus", "Hours": 621.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: September 15, 2021", "Review": "Do you like sinking hundreds of hours in games for almost no reward!

What do you Want me to say?No. Really. Everyone has reviewed this game to death. Everyone. Everyone reviews this game to death when a new expansion comes out, when a new season comes out. You cant even have a new exotic come out without half of youtube gathering around in what can only be described as the worlds most impressive sausage party since that one time in Boot Camp...Want to know whats happening right now as I write this particular review? All the major streamers and youtubers are working with a reddit group building a massive complicated map out of hexagons. Trying to work out what kind of riddle Bungie has placed within the infinite corridors of time, a place where if the lore is correct, Osiris forks millions of versions of himself to explore all the possible outcomes of various scenarios. Were merely scraping the very tip of this particular iceberg.This is the kind of in game puzzle lunacy that very few games can put together. Possibly only some of the Alice and Smith craziness comes close. World of Warcraft? Nah. ESO? Not on your life. FFXIV? Not likely. Not like this. This is where you have people who now have pencils sticking out of their hair screaming \"HEXES ALL THE WAY DOWN BRUH!\" due to not sleeping for 36 hours trying to make sense of all this.So this community is passionate, the game is so well trodden that by now theres well rehearsed guides out for a raid within 24h of launch and by a week theres a community of Sherpas, charitable souls who are willing to teach the raid to newbies, and by a month LFG discords are doing speedruns of the place.That said, the raids never get strictly easy, even the old ones, its very possible to scuff them (Last Wish in particular remains a great place for rusty players to trip up - myself included), but the game strikes a good balance between providing accessibility to new players and people who are more casually inclined (A close friend of mine Ive been guiding and working with to slowly build up the confidence for nightfalls and some of the older raids has had the time of their life), and just as easily it caters to people with no social life who just have to grind for that god roll gun (HI! I WANT MY FEEDING FRENZY SLASH KILL CLIP COLD FRONT STILL YOU GITS).So its good. Is it great?Id call Destiny the greatest 7/10 in existence. Destiny 2 is probably the greatest 8/10 in existence. Its still nowhere near the kind of game that blows people away, but it can very easily lull you into that flow of shoot, loot, repeat that just skims hours away, and you can still feel like youve made progress even when you hit the gear cap because generally unless youre someone like Datto, theres usually something else to do.Its not a game that -tells- you what to do and where to go, you have to set your own goals and then work from there, once youre done with the Story Content what you get out of this game hinges on what you feel like putting in. Its perfectly possible to play through the Red War (FOR FREE NO LESS) and come away thinking \"That was nice\", put the game down and have done.If however you want a looter shooter that you can dip into either once a day for an hour or for several hours, and the game consistently rewards your commitment, then this does the job. More to the point it does the job somewhat better than Warframe does -at this point- (Warframe, I love you, but youre a mess, you need to fix yourself). Yes, the Eververse is going to be a pervasive problem (I know that the art department are distinct from other teams, but I get the sense some of their best work is going to Eververse and could go into challenging quests), and I feel that once you clear the Season Pass max they should be offering what is now the equivalent of Bright Engrams every third or fourth level, as opposed to every fifth (seriously, this feels too stingy once you get over the top of the mountain). Theres some rewards IN the Season Pass that really dont belong (Like Glimmer, Legendary Shards and Bright Dust), but the Season Pass itself is decent value.So where does that leave us.Destiny 2 is by no means perfect. The Crucible needs -desperate- attention. Gambit is also in need of serious love. If next season doesnt offer a new raid I suspect there will be riots as well (Running Garden of Salvation is getting old), there also needs to be new ideas aside from \"Lets make new Menageries\" for the seasonal content. The idea of the infinite paths maze -should- clue Bungie into some new ideas involving branching path dungeons which lead to different bosses (and by extension, different loot). Implementing that could prove challenging.That said, my 600 hours should stand testament that this game has managed to supplant World of Warcraft as my drug of choice.Make of that what you will.Verdict : Recommended ", "Author": "Hobbes", "Hours": 916.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 25, 2019", "Review": "So Ive put over 1000 hours on this game at launch on console over 2 years.

They are constantly fine-tuning and balancing. They are creating a living breathing solar system. It separate from Blizzard and Activision years ago and consistantly have spoken against them. A lot of the issues they are fixing now were a result of that former partnership as well as some bad ideas that made it in that they realized afterward were bad. If you feel lost hit me up on steam,@PizzaParker Commented:\"you lost me when you said this game has a \"living, breathing solar system\" Tell that to the infinite number of Hive, Forsaken, or Cabal that infinitely spawn in areas the Guardians or whomever have supposedly cleared out and should have taken over like 500 times by now\"My response:They have an answer to that very issue written into the lore and game mechanics.Unlike other games where you leave an area for a time and come back, the enemies you fight are brought in from \"elswhere\"This usually consists of using whatever would seem the most plausible for new enemies to come from, whether is from an abandoned building or cave system, or a unique method of transportation for their race.They dont just \"Pop\" up where they would normally spawn.Regarding Strike Activities, when you are inside of strike instances, enemies are not infinitely respawning, in public Patrol zones they use the mechanics described above. If you listen to the opening dialogue of the strike they write it with vague reasoning such as in the \"Disgraced Strike\" our Fireteam is informed Navote narrowly escaped a previous vanguard operation.In other strikes they have a handful of different openings with different generated names from their \"strike name genorator\" to imply multiple incursions and our team just happened to be \"successful\"Not all content would be timegated though, as that would require them to charge a monthly subscription for service to the game to constantly develop new strikes and zones on a more regular basis than what we get with each season.Now to address the straw-man in the room. I never said they HAVE a \"living, breathing solar system\".What I said was \"They are constantly fine-tuning and balancing.

You get a neat roll that is basically a get out of jail free card and you can triple jump into the stratosphere before people can even track your movement. Dont want to pvp, dont worry, you will be funneled into it anyway. You want Catalysts for exotic weapons? Gotta pvp. You want more weekly powerful engrams? Gotta pvp. You want a clan Powerful Engram, and clan exp? Gotta pvp. If you didnt do the quest to unlock the exotic catalyst for the previous season pass exotic, you dont get the 3x bonus progress so good luck killing 50 guardians with an off meta weapon in a sweaty meta as opposed to 16 and doing 300 activities instead of 100 to obtain a catalyst that you still need to complete for a weapon you probably wont use.PVE: Pretty fun, lots of activities to do assuming Bungie doesnt take them from you in a few months. The gunplay is fun, and responsive, enemies have different tendencies and slight variations between them. Exotics are pretty fun and can change your play style and be very powerful. Build diversity is pretty good, you can mod your armor to the way you want to play even though unlocking all the mods is very trickle feed. You will have to check with vendors everyday/every week as their inventory changes and you will need to do dailies to get the currency to buy them. Speaking of dailies, there are lots of them, they call them bounties in this game. They are not very hard, but they are numerous. The biggest issue I have is that you will inevitably pay for content in this game, and at a whim, Bungie will decide what content is worth keeping and what isnt, not based on a community response or opinion, but what they think at the time. They also have a weird habit of lowering your light level (power level) for certain activities in which you will now find yourself under leveled in order to create challenge (presige/hawkmoon mission, ect). I personally hate this, whats the point of me grinding for gear if you are just going to nerf it? oh and it is a grind, they trickle feed you gear every week. You can only earn so many pinnacle pieces of gear (guaranteed to raise your light level) a week. At a certain point random drops will be capped at a certain light level below what you are (currently soft cap is 1320, max light is 1330) so the only way to get better gear is to wait for next week or get lucky with exotic drops.Cosmetics: There are a bunch, they are expensive. While personally i believe that what you do with your money is your business, and to justify the value of a product is based on personal preference I do think the cosmetics are a tad pricey. But they are cosmetic, so buy them, dont buy them, thats up to you. Dont let people money shame you, if you want the cool gun skin/emote/sparrow/ghost shell, get it and tell people to pound sand!TLDR: Overall its pretty fun, but the more you play the more you feel disenfranchised with it. At the rate that Bungie is self cannibalising this game with story content removal and funneling players into activities they may not want to do (PVP/PVE), Im not sure how long the average player will want to play. Especially since they probably dont know whats going on anymore if they are new or took a break from the game for a while. It costs a pretty penny to experience all of Destinys time limited content.", "Author": "Pockets", "Hours": 362.4}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 18, 2020", "Review": "Bungie and destiny have both had their ups and downs over the years and i have put off writing this review for months, caught between the fond memories and the bleak reality.i am going to be breaking this review into the categories of Price, Gameplay and Story that should hopefully help to give a sense of whether you should bother.  Price  Despite claiming to be free to play that is nothing but \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 since the latest expansion that gutted away most of the former expansions (yes, they screwed the people who needed to pay) that were the largest part of this free to play chunk. i am not exaggerating when i say there is nearly nothing for a free player to do in terms of progression.If, on the other hand, you choose to buy all of the expansions you will be in a constant loop of hope, disappointment and regret. expansions are almost never worth the prices and usually only have around 10-12 hours of new content (outside of grind) and maybe a new activity or raid in some of the better ones. the latest expansion is the price of a AAA game for \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 sake. Gameplay  Gunplay is the speciality of bungie and that mastery is on full display, destiny is fast paced and strongly encourages you to be constantly moving, when you hear people comparing it to warframe this is what they are talking about.Beyond gunplay, destiny has a horribly grindy gameplay loop that boils down to this: \"find stronger weapon/armour piece, replace old, find new, replace old.\" this is then regularly raised to promote going after equipment from the latest expansion and results in the older equipment obsolete at all stages of the game (and hurting the playability of older content in general, this was nowhere near as bad in destiny 1). what i just described is why you will find so much backlash for the lack of weapons in beyond light.Bungie killed any sense of progression. instead of putting new players at the start of its base game campaign and encouraging them to follow in the footsteps of players before them (like literally every good MMO or RPG and slowly opening the game up to the player digestable chunks and giving them the context of what is happening bungie decided to implement new light and haphazardly start the player at a high light level (power system based on the sum of all of your equipment) and dump everything on them at once and hide all the old content and context inside what amounts to a closet. when i got into destiny 2 it was as part of this \"new light\" wave, where there is no sense of direction and no obvious objective to work towards. Story This category is going to contain \"plot\" and \"world\" points.If you are looking for great storytelling then you are in the wrong place, characters are paper-thin outside of lore tomes, campaigns are usually generic and lack any depth or impact with only a couple of exceptions like forsaken (an expansion) and the red war (the base campaign they buried in an obscure place). a big and consistent problem have is not making the room to build any kind of attachment to what is happening or properly explain the context of the perticular story (for players reading this. YES, they might explain this in some of the lore entries. that is not an excuse). on top of all of this they tend to start more than they finish in every single storyline.Another big problem that echoes throughout all of these issues i mentioned... they expect you to have been here from the start, bungie expects that the player be familiar with everything that happened over the course of 6 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 years worth of destiny content while making most of that hard to access... who had that bright idea? But, for all of the many problems the storytelling has, bungie does not fail to offer world-building that shows their care and thought in every detail of the environment. the lore is full of stories about the many characters you meet and the locations you go to were built around, more often than not you can look at anything and find an answer for why it is there. unfortunately these are not weaved into the plot where they would go a long way to resolve some of the issues i have expressed. Conclusion Bungie and the work they have put into destiny since 2014 are the epitome of wasted potential, by poor choices they have taken the ingredients to what could have been a great game and soiled them... i stood by it for the best part of those 6 years, across both D1 and D2 i had hoped that they could pull through. time and time again they have failed and promised to do better...time and time again they have broken their promise, no more.Thank you all for reading the entire review and i invite you to comment with improvements and corrections to the review, i am also open to discussion but you can go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourself if you come looking for an argument (or in a nicer way, be civil)", "Author": "Koschei Morevna", "Hours": 1360.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 26, 2020", "Review": "i have no idea whats happening, but i like it.", "Author": "k4N4", "Hours": 3.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 23, 2019", "Review": "This game is awesome ive never played Destiny and Destiny 2 b4 it came to steam so i was pretty lost tbh when i started this game. :DWell if you are new in this game like i was just go to the tower search for Amanda Holliday so youll start the main campaign which are divided in 3 parts kinda The Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind after you finish all of them you can continue to playing now with the DLCs Shadowkeep in the moon and Forsaken in the Tangled Shore.The multiplayer is pretty good and you have many ways like crucible, vanguard and my favorite gambit ^_^also since is an online-only multiplayer FPS you always will find people to help you during the quests and bounties, once you hit the \"maximum lvl which is 900\" you can keep leveling up altho it takes time and you need to lvl up your armour, guns, legendary engram, etc. I am lvl 908 atm but some people are 970 or more i guess. Destiny 2 has microtransactions of course but its not a problem at all and if you are new to the game and you want to have the season 9 youll spend just a few bucks to buy 2300 silvers so youll be able to buy the season 9 and armour and guns  for your character, if i recall it was 1k of silvers for the season 9 and silvers is the currency of the game.Well is a very good game altho sometimes Bungie servers are down, and you cant play it offline >.> the only way you play this game is online ^_^ but they are working on it, i presume since it has been a few days that the servers are alright and they finally fixed the error called honeydew https://twitter.com/bungiehelp/status/1204566072990433280 which were making impossible to finish the forsaken campaign but they fixed it a couple days ago and i finished it.Destiny 2  9/10 Heisen.

These were sold on battle net for over $100 CAD at the time. About a year later on September 4, 2018 they released the forsaken campaign. This too was sold on battle net for over $100 CAD. Some time afterwards bungie announced that they will no longer be working with activision/blizzard and released the new shadowkeep campaign on steam on October 1, 2019. Like clockwork on November 10, 2020 the beyond light campaign was released as well as the introduction of the content vault. This vault removed the entirety of the 2017 campaign. Bungies explanation at the time as to why this was needed included saving the user disk space, less server strain, removing spaghetti code, shortening compile time and less need for lengthy QA/bug reports. It is my opinion that this makes the devs sound incompetent as no other MMO or live service has ever removed the base campaign without introducing some sort of remastered version. Fast forward to February 22, 2022 the witch queen campaign release also saw the removal of 2018 content. Just like the red war before it the forsaken campaign has now been vaulted. Thats over $200 worth of content gone for \"reasons.\" At no point on the store page nor upon check out was there a message stating \"WARNING: THIS IS TIMED CONTENT. IT WILL BE REMOVED ON A DATE YET TO BE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE.\" To add insult to injury you can still buy the forsaken dlc for $25 even though 90% of the content is inaccessible. Now bungie devotees will tell you to \"just get over it\" or \"forget about the old stuff and go consume the new stuff instead\" or my personal favorite \"real fans shouldnt care because they played and replayed through the campaigns multiple times by now\" after losing $200 worth of content. Im sorry but that level of elitist gate keeping has no place in any community let alone gaming so if these are the type of \"fans\" the devs want to keep then this game isnt worth supporting.All vaulted content should be turned into optional installable DLC. Full stop. This allows the user to make the decision what to do with the content they paid for. Yes there is a TOS/EULA but Im sure that it wouldnt be sound in a court of law in a country with consumer protections. Doubtful? Have you heard of lootboxes before? How about Electronic Arts? Battlefront 2? I rest my case. Bungie has a choice, either find a way to return the content they have illegitimately removed or turn this game completely free to play and sell skins/loot boxes to milk its dwindling player base. No one and I do mean no one wants to walk into a movie half way through its runtime or start a tv show at the midpoint and expect to be invested in the story. \"But this game is really about loot and pew pewing things with your gun\" say the zealots but rest assured diablo, call of duty and borderlands 3 not only do these things better but they also have the added bonus of not deleting their campaigns post purchase, ever.From humble beginnings to microsoft then activision/blizzard and now more recently sony one thing has been constant, terrible decisions made by bungie upper management. Their one claim to fame has been creating halo and while revolutionary at the time its obvious to anyone that they have been resting on their laurels ever since. I started playing destiny since the beginning on playstation 3 and it breaks my heart seeing a game you love slowly get gutted from the inside out so it brings me no pleasure in saying we need a break.

I have learned that Bungie has returned Mars to the fold. While I still do not like the content vault, a promise is a promise, and so too must my guardian return to the field of battle against those who would threaten the Traveler and Last City, Earth. Perhaps there is yet hope. I do love the world of Destiny, and not even a blasted content vault can take that away.Original Post from 1/02/22:As of this writing, I have played 230.2 hours on Destiny 2, not including the hundreds of hours I played Destiny via Xbox one. I started playing Destiny back when The Taken King came out, then played the Destiny 2 main campaign on my Xbox. Then I went to college, and by the time I got a computer fast enough to play this on Steam and made a New Light account, It was Season of the Chosen, the Cabal one. I have purchased and played Forsaken, Shadowkeep, and Beyond Light, as well as Season of the Chosen, Splicer, and at least half of Lost.Those are my credentials, if you will. I absolutely love the world, the music, the concept art and everything else about Destiny and Destiny 2. I love near everything about what Bungie has done, but the sole reason I have stopped playing Destiny 2 is the content vault. Why should I buy and play an expansion, if it will be vaulted a couple years later? Its gonna hurt when Forsakens plug is pulled come February 22, because I love that expansion, I daresay more than whatever would come with the Witch Queen.There is no permanent ownership when it comes to the dlcs, here. Because it took me a while to get a pc that can run Destiny, I missed out on at least ten seasons, the Leviathan, Mars, and the list of vaulted content could go on and on, but Im trying to be brief. So Forsaken will be vaulted to make space for the Witch Queen. One day, Shadowkeep will likely get vaulted for Lightfall or another future story. Eventually even the currently hyped-up Witch Queen expansion will get cut out, unwilling pulled from the table, from the arms of gamers who love and play it, at least with Destiny 2s current game-vaulting design. This is why I stopped playing.If this one issue was fixed, I would return to Destiny 2, Destiny 3, and beyond with open arms. I have this game installed right now on steam, and I love this game, but I cannot play it, what with the content vault inevitably cutting away what I have bought. Is there no way to just make the game bigger? Id sacrifice disk space if it meant being able to keep what I buy. Surely there are bigger games than Destiny 2 that dont use content vaults--I dont see Call of Duty doing this, for example, and that game is has more MBs. I could be wrong.Just something to think about, something to consider. Bungie, please save the game you made. I have the utmost faith that the content vault is not the way of the Light.

And the new gamemode punishes you for not winning since you face cheaters so often that you barely get any wins to qualify for the minimum rewards on your 3 wins.The MTX store in this game is a total mess, you barely get any Bright Dust which is the free currency that you get for playing the game unless you slave yourself to play gamemodes that you dont like on all 3 character slots and dont get me started on the costs of some BD items (a single cool emote can cost up to 4,200 BD while you earn 200 BD per weekly bounty) ofc you can just buy its premium MTX currency, Silver! which most of the items are also expensive as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ($10 worth of Silver for a weapon skin or $20 in silver for a character skin)This game has gone downhill since it went F2P, a lot of hackers and the content is barely mediocre at best nothing from Shadowkeep was memorable (Except for the Raid and Dungeon which those two pieces of content were really good) apart from that, this game has lost its way.", "Author": "Kilsie", "Hours": 4602.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: August 10, 2021", "Review": "ADA-1 has left you a message Guardian:\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2818\u287f\u289b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u2838\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2880\u283c\u28db\u28db\u28ed\u28ad\u28df\u28db\u28db\u28db\u283f\u283f\u2886\u2860\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2838\u28ff\u28ff\u28a3\u28b6\u28df\u28ff\u28d6\u28ff\u28f7\u28fb\u28ee\u287f\u28fd\u28ff\u28fb\u28d6\u28f6\u28e4\u28ed\u2849\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b9\u2823\u28db\u28e3\u28ed\u28ed\u28ed\u28c1\u285b\u283b\u28bd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fd\u2867\u2844\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28cc\u285b\u28bf\u28fd\u2898\u28ff\u28f7\u28ff\u287b\u280f\u28db\u28c0\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2819\u2845\u28ff\u281a\u28e1\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28f0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u2804\u28f1\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u28f8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2823\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u281b\u2811\u28ff\u28ee\u28dd\u28db\u283f\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2804", "Author": "NovaxkT", "Hours": 71.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 19, 2019", "Review": "After 70 hours im still a F2P pleb who havent given Bungie a single dollar but I will.

However, introducing new players has been reworked several times, with each iteration making it more and more confusing to get into the game without the assistance of friends who have already played for quite sometime.On top of this, the expansion packs are largely overpriced for what they provide. I do not tend to subscribe to the \"1 dollar = 1 hour\" mindset, but the newer campaigns have gotten shorter and shorter whilst also forcing players to backtrack more and more. The most recent update has gutted many of the games more under-utilized (and free to play) systems and mechanics, and while I would not mind if these were going to return, many of these events, mechanics, and gamemodes have been recycled into \"newer content\" despite being nothing more than reskins. Bungies idea of the \"games-as-a-service model\" is to force players to drag through largely uninteresting, repetitive missions and mechanics for weapons that will dominate the PvP and cosmetics that will be forgotten in less than a week of release.Therein lies Destiny 2s most prevalent problem - recycled content. While not nearly as noticeable to new players, returning players have become intimately familiar with this whether or not they choose to comment or even consciously notice it. Events are repeated, missions are recycled, and gameplay is a small, shallow loop that is only given depth through temporary, broken weapons that will be nerfed once the season is over only so that players can repeat the grind once more a few months later to unlock whatever the next intentionally broken weapon they choose to add is. This is felt primarily in the \"Sunset\" system. Weapons are given a finite time that they are allowed to be \"top-tier,\" at which point they are given an arbitrary cap where they can no longer be utilized effectively in the games meta. This seems to be done almost exclusively to force long-term players back into the grind once they have exhausted the current seasons offerings, with little to no actual thought gone into it otherwise. It also appears to be driven by the games lifecycle - Destiny 2 has been around for so long that they appear to be running out of \"unique abilities\" to give weapons. I suspect that old, intentionally nerfed perks will see a return in the coming years as \"new content,\" with the hope that veteran players will simply not notice or even appreciate Bungie readding content they intentionally removed beforehand.However, this \"recycled content\" runs on a far deeper level than the typical games-as-a-service model that is designed to trap you into playing the game forever. In all of my years of playing Destiny 2 (I had far more hours on Battle.net), I have never once seen a truly \"unique\" weapon. Yes, weapons differ in visual aesthetic, but their layouts are kept entirely similar so that they can continue to utilize the same four reload animations that they have used since the games release. Guns, events, and enemies are not made unique via modelwork or interesting mechanics, and instead are made unique via simple tweaks of particle effects, colors, and other basic, uninteresting ways that you only begin to feel once you have played the game for several hundred hours.Some may call such a complaint picky, but after four years, I do not consider it unreasonable to expect that Bungie try something at least a little more complex than giving an old event a new coat of paint or even introducing a new enemy that isnt simply a model swap of an existing enemy type. Destiny 2s combat loop can only survive on its own for so long, and they have done little on the enemy-type side of things to shake things up. When they do, it is almost invariably a mistake and makes the enemies feel unfun to play against.At this point, Im not sure who Destiny 2 is for. As an older player, I am tired of letting Bungie continue to get away with effectively putting zero effort into their game. I suspect the experience will be largely unfun for new players as well, as little thought has been put into their introduction aside from figuring out how to suck their money out of the wallet and put their nose to the grinding stone.If you still find yourself defending Bungie, ask yourself honestly - at what point do you have Stockholm Syndrome for an experience with a game that no longer exists?", "Author": "Hypo", "Hours": 106.6}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 27, 2020", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "RamenSquire", "Hours": 3410.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 31, 2021", "Review": "After 1.2 hours of play I can say with absolute confidence that this is a game.Edit: After 134 hours played, can confirm.

Over the last year they had done nothing but built my trust by making the best playstate the game had ever seen, but when September 2021 rolled around, they dashed it all with a single announcement, and since then its nothing but worse and worse news.The game is incredibly unfriendly to new players with its tutorial questlines and intro being barebones and confusing. It locks new players into a playstyle that doesnt allow friends to aid them. They get handheld and then dumped, with no way to accurately apply the information they learned or how to properly advance their light levels or power. In fact, the light level system is utterly glossed over in favor of just teaching the bare necessities with overbloated content.The paywall makes this even worse as you (as of writing this review) have to pay 70 dollars for all previous expansions, a 70 dollar bundle for the deluxe version of the current expansion so you can actually experience content that is already gone, and then pay another 100 dollars with the newest expansions content (which is 20 dollars more than previous iterations of this package due to a singular dungeon). Not to mention the fact that now they fully intend to monetize dungeons--a previously free set of content in that it would come with the base purchase of the expansion. As it stands Bungie has purchasing expansions, purchasing season passes, freemium currency, and purchasing dungeons all as forms of monetization (if we dont include their merchandising of items you unlock access to via playing) which is 4 forms of monetization on a supposedly free game.The actual gameplay of the game is solid with fluid combat and solid weapon selections as of now, but it seems that Bungie is dedicated to utterly undercutting this feeling by attacking specific builds players might like and outright making them utterly unusable while also making wild changes to the state of the game for the purposes of \"making guns feel better\" despite weapons determing whether or not you can clear content dungeon or up, let alone actual endgame content.3/10--Fix your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game, Bungie.", "Author": "KING CLEAN ASS", "Hours": 2001.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 23, 2020", "Review": "I\u2019m a PvE player and Voidwalker main, so expect some bias. The Good:2,000+ hours spent playing Destiny 2... and thats just on Steam.  What can I say, I love this game.  Its addictive!  Ive met some of my closest friends and my partner through the Destiny universe.  It\u2019s the reason why I\u2019ll always keep coming back to this game.  Overall, I highly recommend it.  The Destiny universe is like a second home.  It\u2019s one of the most immersive game worlds I\u2019ve experienced.  Bungie has really created something special with Destiny.  They put an incredible level of detail into this world.  Whether you\u2019re being silly dancing in the Tower, running strikes or doing a Grandmaster Nightfall, it\u2019s immersive and, most importantly, fun!  The gunplay feels phenomenal, unmatched by any other game Ive ever played.  Bungie is the king of gunplay.  After years of playing, it\u2019s still so very satisfying to land headshots.  The sound effect is so cool!   The gameplay, abilities and movement are smooth and seamless.  As a looter shooter, its second to none.  If you\u2019re a completionist, there\u2019s a lot to chase - god roll weapons and armour, mods, ships, sparrows, exotics, emotes, triumphs, titles and lore etc.  Although people complain about weapons being reskinned, there\u2019s also countless unique weapons to earn.  The lore is rich and you can get lost reading it and watching YouTube videos discussing it.  The graphics are exceptional with expansive environments and beautiful visuals.  The soundtrack is excellent, as is (most of) the voice acting.  I mainly play PvE content and love the thrill of solo challenges.  The game is more fun to play with friends of course, whether you\u2019re doing strikes, dungeons, raids, exploring or playing PvP \u2013 there\u2019s a tonne of content right at your fingertips.  I don\u2019t enjoy PvP, but that\u2019s just my own preference and not a reflection of the game.  Beyond Light is enjoyable in my opinion.  Europa is fun to explore, although the heavy snowstorms, whilst visually impressive, can get annoying when youre trying to navigate your way through them.  The Stasis subclasses are unique, and its cool to see darkness subclasses being implemented.  I still use my old reliables though - Voidwalker, Sunbreaker and Nightstalker respectively on each class.  Hopefully the light subclasses will take advantage of the new customisation options in the future.  I found the Necrotric Grip gauntlets to be a lot of fun and would love to see poison subclasses being introduced as well.   Here\u2019s hoping!The Bad:Destiny Content Vault and sunsetting, Im looking at you!  First off, sunsetting.  Sunsetting sucks!  My Recluse with 133k kills will never be forgotten and I still don\u2019t have the heart to dismantle it.  Spending hours, days or weeks chasing various weapons and armour, only to have them rendered useless in endgame content due to the level cap hurts.  Secondly, we have the Destiny Content Vault (DCV) which swooped in and removed Mars, Mercury, Titan and Io, and their respective activities.  I loved Escalation Protocol and both Mars strikes.  Seeing them, various strikes, raids, Menagerie and forges being removed was definitely a blow.  I think it\u2019s safe to say that the DCV and sunsetting has annoyed most of the community.  I remain hopeful that it will turn out to be a good decision once location and activities are reworked and reintroduced.  Time will tell.  Lastly, having to do the same thing on all 3 characters is both tedious and very time consuming and makes me feel like Bungie doesn\u2019t appreciate my time.  The Ugly:You\u2019ll always find that the critics will always shout loudest - that\u2019s to be expected.  Negative reviews are fine and everyone\u2019s entitled to their own opinion.  A lot of the reviews I\u2019ve read are fair, make valid points and offer constructive criticism.  Something I\u2019d like to point out is that a lot of the complaints flooding the internet stems from salty free to play (F2P) players.  Making the game free to play was good as it breathed new life into the game and made it more accessible to people.  Great!  However, some F2P players expect every single aspect of the game be made available to them for free and refuse to purchase any expansions, then have the cheek to post negative reviews because of paywalls.  I mean, come on, talk about self-entitlement.  There\u2019s still F2P content even after DCV, key word being free.  Anyway, my advice would be to take such reviews with a pinch of salt and focus on the more balanced reviews.  TL;DR \u2013 Great game, incredibly immersive.  Some room for improvement.

Meanwhile, theres STILL no vendor refresh after years of asking, MORE reskins for f2p armor (Trials finally comes back and its armor is a reskin, are you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 kidding me Bungie?), new weapons with entirely worthless perk pools (while the threat of our old weapons being taken away from us still looms), constant nerfs to everything mildly powerful, new exotics are crap and feel useless, I could go on.And let\u2019s talk about \u201ccontent\u201d. Yet another season of Bounty Simulator, with seraph bunkers literally being obelisks 2.0. Go grind for materials to upgrade this vendor so you can buy upgrades to go grind for more materials so you can buy bounties to farm for weapons, that\u2019ll be $10 please. Yes, thrilling game content, very fun. Strikes are still \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 worthless, no new raid or even raid lair that we got with Activision, no new story content aside from half-assed fetch quest dialogue from a half-assed replacement for Ana\u2019s VA. The main story continues to move in no discernible direction, rather we have to deal with three month long side quests every single season despite Bungie\u2019s promise that the story will \u201ccarry over\u201d to the next season.God I miss old Destiny.

It has a very diverse world with a lot to do and discover if you are new to it. However, new content seems to struggle to be engaging and a lot of power leveling and collecting becomes monotonous. The emphasis on staying up to the highest power to stay competitive in high level activities effects every player at the beginning of every season so everyone has to regrind old activities to enjoy new ones. It can burn out veteran players who dont want to regrind to be able to play content they were previously able to do. It can also be daunting for new players to catch up to the more experienced ones and seems to be a hurdle a lot of returning players come across.The pvp is an interesting movement shooter, but some glaring issues with cheaters makes it a hard sell for high level pvp players looking to test their merit against other legit players. The lack of a visibly active and effective anti cheat makes this free-to-play game victim to many hackers and exploiters who become very apparent at the higher levels of pvp. Additionally the lack of support for the pvp sandbox can be infuriating for die-hard players. Many instances in the past have shown that weapons were far too effective and were getting far more play in pvp than anything at the time. It took months for these weapons to be adjusted and even years for the one eyed mask exotic helmet. Overall I cant quite recommend this game to new people anymore despite the love I used to have for it. I have sunk many days of my life into this game and to see it in this state is unfortunate. I hope Bungie can turn it around but after a year and a half of hoping I have mostly given up.EDIT: The game has changed a lot since I first wrote this review and Bungie has fixed most (if not all) of my complaints I had in my original review. The game is constantly changing and fixes have been implemented in a timely manner ever since the new engine was implemented. The world is still extremely diverse, beautiful and feels like its evolving season to season. I personally cant bring myself to grind every single weapon like I used to do, but I blame that more on my own personal fatigue rather than a gameplay flaw. I would say there isnt much a reason to not check this title out now.

Its good, but has a few downsides that I cant ignore.   Is it worth buying? The initial cost is 0$, so yes. However, if you have any plans whatesover on playing more of the game, you will have to pay probably 80$+. Is the dlcs worth buying? I would say it depends on the person. For a casual I would say its better to just find a new game, for those who really like destiny, its not a problem to spend a little extra on additional content.   Content & Replay Value: Replay value when it comes to story I would say is close to 0, but the replay value of the pvp and raids are very good. There are at least 100+ hours of quality content here, and much more if you really enjoy the game. Pros1.The gunplay is fantastic. Guns pack a proper punch. The handling feels solid, and there is nothing better than sniping another guardian in the head. The movement slightly differs from class to class but the mix of dodges and jumps provides more flexibility and a greater skill gap. There are certainly some balancing needed, however all in all I would say the gunplay is great.2.The dungeons and raids are a great combination of puzzles, combat, parkour and boss fights. To finish a raid you pretty much have to have a mic and communicate with your team, but as long as your team consists of your friends its gonna be a great time. However, if your team is filled with randoms, prepare for a horrible time.3.The uniqueness of exotic perks are truly where destiny shines. It can range from \"Melee kills restore health for a short duration.\" to \"Sliding reflects projectiles\". These exotics can drastically change your playstyle and makes the replay value a whole lot better.Cons1.Yes this game is free. However, if you plan on playing any of the end game, or have any cool or unique armor or guns, you will have to spend money on DLCs. Playing this game without any DLCs is like eating french fries without salt, its possible... but are you okay?2.If none of your friends play destiny 2, good luck with the end game content. You will be constantly reminded of how brain dead randoms can be. Also, playing destiny alone can be extremely boring. I personally NEVER boot the game if none of my friends are down to join. This may be very subjective but I can not play this game alone and not go insane.3.The general destiny community is pretty decent. Dont get me wrong, I have made some great friends through raids and dungeons, however the illusion of a friendly non-toxic community dissolves once you enter ranked PvP in any form. It is insane how many entitled bottom fraggers I have met. So many people join, dont say a word the whole game, gets 27 damage, and rages once you lose. PvP can be great fun, just highly unlikely to achieve with randoms. Now there are exceptions to this as well, just extremely rare.4.Destiny does this fun little thing called \"Vaulting content\" which in long terms means removing content youve paid for. This is extremely infuriating. Removing the less actively played content players paid for, vaulting them, and \"maybe re-using them\" is not an acceptable excuse and a certain way to lose players. Entire planets disappearing, huge storylines gone, several guns and armor pieces no longer able to acquire. This is very unfortunate for new players as they will most likely never experience those missions and never get their hands on the items.5.The matchmaking in this game is crazy. I can not tell you the amount of times me and my friend has queued for a match, and our teammate gets 0-25 damage per round, while every enemy has at least 3k hours in game and hits you the split second you peek. The matchmaking is truly a joke. You can not play this game seriously without having teammates before you queue. Bugs & issuesAs for ghost melee and the revive feature not working sometimes, its rather self explanatory. Sometimes when you hit a melee, it doesnt deal any damage and sometimes when you revive someone, they doesnt actually get revived. This can lead to you loosing a very intense fight due to something that shouldnt have happened, causing frustration, anger and maybe even sadness.  TechnicalI use an i5 10400f with a 2070 super 8gb Vram and 32gb ram with a 280hz 1080p monitor, using a combination of mid to max settings and im sitting at around 180fps in pvp on average. It may drop down to around 140, but its never unstable or causes drastic fps drops. You will most likely not have any trouble with fps or performance if you have a decent PC.Verdict: Good, but not greatAll in all, Destiny 2 offers fun and satisfying PvP, unique armor and guns as well as fantastic raids and dungeons.

Buy the ALL the DLC to enjoy the game to its fullest extent.Being a DLC owner, I actually really enjoy playing Destiny 2. The gunplay feels good, the co-op is fun with raids, the PvP is horribly meta heavy, but the game is really good with friends.With the release of Beyond Light however, I cant recommend this game anymore, as Bungie removed most of the game. F2P players have so little content now, its really not even worth it even being free. The main campaign and the first 2 free DLC campaigns are now gone, along with ALL the exotics they brought, leaving only the extremely boring open world events, and a handful of strikes that get very boring after a short amount of time. F2P players also lose out on being able to play any raid, which is really sad, because thats the best part of the PvE.It really is disappointing, just the sheer amount of content that was removed, to make way for a new DLC that gets force fed to you every so often after loading into the hub.

I just took it as it was and forgave the game for this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 presentment, then went with following the ghosts instructions. The first engagements and gameplay got me interested, there was gear and it looked very interesting, but the story didnt make any sense at this point. Despite this I still wanted to know more so I continued playing.2. \" Gameplay looks nice, but who are these people, what is going on? \" - After killing a certain dungeon boss thingy, I was transferred to the tower, still with no explanation to what the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is going on, who are these enemies and what is actually happening. The next day when I got into the game, Zavala started explaining how Mars, Io and whatever the hell disappeared and nobody knows why. At this point I was.... well \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this, I have no idea what is happening, but the gameplay at least looks nice, so I continued playing and killing in EDZ. Then I noticed that EDZ means European dead zone and I understood that this is Earth and something bad happened. Of course there were the cuteness about the darkness, the traveler etc, but still nothing made clear sense. 3. \" Probably just another DLC spam title, but looks promising. Genuinely interested \" - The mystic had drawn me in, as I am a sucker for Humanity vs Aliens themes and I really wanted to check on why all of these things happened, who is the traveler and this darkness. Did I fight it already, how does it look, why does it do the things that it does? Turns out, nothing of this is in the game or at least presented to the free player. It is at this point that I wanted to buy DLCs, simply to find out more about the story, I checked if destiny 1 is on steam and of course found out it wasnt, checked a few videos on what DLCs are actually good to buy first.4. \" The good, the bad and the DCV \" - I found out something weird, some DLCs were not on the store, but were mentioned on the videos I watched, so naturally I asked myself why. Maybe there were added in a whole bundle or a delux edition, so I went on to check this. Turns out, I missed on basically the whole game and it has already been removed. At this point, I was doing dungeon all the time and I learned almost the whole story by watching videos. This of course left a very sour taste in my mouth. Why would I pay for something so that it can be removed? I did not like this, hence I reached for more information, maybe they would reverse this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 move. I am a new player and I wanted to buy, but why would I buy if I am in essence buying a continuation to a story that I had no part in and I cannot access anymore?5. \" The unfortunate circumstance of being new in the plans of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 planner \" -  I understood that this game was for existing players and made sure to slap every new player for the unfortunate fact that they \" missed \" the whole game and if they wanted to keep up, they should rely on youtube and also pay for a continuation to a story that they didnt even had the chance to experience. They removed content to  \"improve the game\" and \"keep it going\". Well, sure but as a new played the game didnt even had the chance to start. I enjoy good old grinding, but I hate the fact that you have to grind to continue to grind + no story, until you watch youtube and pay to continue said story until it gets removed again.6. \" The buyers sins and the uncertain future of gaming \" -  I said to myself - No, no buying. Wondering if I should delete the game presently, despite the nice gameplay and I probably will. If their excuse to remove content is simply that they want to improve the game (loading,etc) and focus on what is coming next, then I simply disagree. Removal of content should not be supported in any way shape or form. If this practice continues, then I am really afraid for gamings future. You know whats the weird part? I would gladly drop 200 bucks on their ass for the whole content right now, but I simply cant as it is not there. So once again, why would I buy a DLC, that will be removed mind you, to continue a story which I cannot experience anymore? I wont. This way of doing things basically kills the influx of new players and if you do that, you kill your future. Thank god we have Steam and the ability to call things the way they are, wonder if this is on other platforms and people are as fortunate as us. Completely asinine behaviour and business model, I cant believe this studio made Halo.7. \"Desperate plea\" To all gamers who have common sense left in their soul and midns - do not support this. By paying for it you simply state to them that it works and they can get away with it. They shouldnt, not because I am salty and I cry or anything, but because this effectively destoys the ownership of virtual products. Ask yourself what would gaming look like today, if this thing was with us from the start and where will it lead us if we support it with open arms.For the people who want to attack me and state my playtime as an excuse that I had a lot to do as a new player - I like this game, I really do and I want to support its development. I want to see more, but the way its handled is something that shakes me to my very core. The gameplay is there and you can deffinitely have fun with it, but the way its butchered is simply not right.

It is almost removing the entire first two years of the game, all in one go. As well as the fact all of years 3s seasonal content goes away at the end of its season.As of september this year i will have spent money for the base game, 3 season passes (8 seasons) and 2 full size DLCs (all up around $300 australian dollars). But only 2 of those full size DLCs and 2 seasons will still be in the game (a fair bit less than $150 worth of content) And if i want to fill a small amount of that void i have to spend another $60 on the upcoming DLC.Also, my hours may be lowish here, but know that i had another 800+ back when destiny 2 was on BNET rather than Steam.You might say, \"well how can you not recommend it if you have that many hours\".Thats because all that content being removed above made up easily 2/3 (66%) of my play time.They are removing so much, and whats being added \"to replace it\" is the cost of a brand new game. I lose content i paid for and have to pay AGAIN to fill that spot, bungie are absolutely insane.I genuinely will be seeing if this can be taken up with the ACCC in australia to get a refund for purchased content that is being taken away (lets not mention the fact they already F2Ped a fair bit of it, that i could understand, but this is straight up removing it from the game).and let me tell you reason they are removing all this content. slightly paraphrased but from their own stream. Its because \"its too hard to take care of bugs and such in that much content\" and \"that its hard to add new content in amongst game systems from the old DLCs\".They have complained about their engine multiple times over the last 5 years.But instead of take any action and really overhaul what they are working with they are deleting content so that they can add new stuff more easily. It is literally due to their own laziness and incompetence, not any actual barriers. Many games have as much content than this and continue to add to it, many games have far larger file size and continue to add stuff fine (looking at you new Modern warfare eating 190gb of my SSD).TL:DR They are removing half the content from the game due to laziness/incompetence in upgrading their engine and software (which they themselves have complained about, but done nothing to for 5 years now).

Be ready to invest money into the game if you want to play the latest expansion (the free portion of the game doesnt include all endgame activities) -> its about 100\u20ac a year to get the expansion and the all the season passes for the year2. Friends or people to play with -> be ready to use LFG, or to meet new people on discord or dive in with friends youve played other games with.The \"endgame\" PvE content is locked behind the power of friendship. You have to have a premade party to go into raids and master/grandmaster content.The PvP content is also decently looked after although it could probably be better. Dont expect a classic FPS experience because there is a lot of verticality and a lot of abilities being used left and right and sometimes things will happen that you wont understand at first. Just be patient and keep trying or skip the PvP part entirely if you want to. The game doesnt force you to play it but does give incentives (like special loot that only drops from certain PvP activities).I picked up this game when it first came out, then I stopped since I was playing alone. I picked it up again when Forsaken came out, played the story and then I stopped since I was playing alone. I picked it up again earlier this year with a friend of mine and we started meeting tons of new people and now were doing raids on a weekly basis (which is something I thought I would never be able to do). Ive been playing regularly for the past 9 months and I still feel like logging on all the time. The number 1 cause of quitting this game is if youre playing solo.One thing sucks (even though its somewhat understandable) -> Bungie (the developer) have a tendency of removing content from the game. So since I only started playing seriously in 2021, the first 4 or 5 raids that came out with the game are no longer available for me to play. Even though we want to do them, even though we have a team ready to go, we cant play it, its not in the game anymore. This is true for part of the campaign as well as some of the destinations (areas) that were available back in year 1 are no longer there. Not that I would do much if I went there, but still, theyre gone, you cant go there at all. I dont care about the destinations, just give me the raids and the dungeons, there is no sense in blocking those off, they were already in the game previously.Now back to the good stuff -> TONS of loot and different weapons and armors and playstyles and almost everything is viable or will become viable at some point. Use whatever you can and want, try stuff out, mess around with classes, builds, weapons that do wacky stuff, its all in there and its so much fun. The graphics look great, the game runs well (I have a 1060 and I have a stable 80-100 FPS at all times), the shooting is crisp, the sound design is on point, its all there. The raids have mechanics that your team has to learn how to do in order to keep going. Its awesome that certain loot only drops from certain activities so you can farm them until you get that weapon and god roll that you really want. I cannot recommend the game enough, truly.That all being said there is a lot to do before you reach endgame and you can decide if you like the game or not by playing the free to play portion of it.Looking forward to headshotting you in the crucible blueberry! :D", "Author": "Ap3x", "Hours": 1278.4}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 9, 2020", "Review": "Oh where to start...TL;DR: Theres a good game in here, somewhere, but Bungie doesnt know how to get to it.So the greatest crime this 2nd job commits is not respecting your time; the RNG is horrible, and the FOMO is real bad. There are usually 1 or 2 good rolls for a weapon, and if you dont have one of them you wont be competitive in PvP; were not even going to get in to the cluster that is armor rolls. The \"game\" demands all of your time; if you miss a couple of weeks, or God forbid an entire season, youll have usually missed out on loot that is not and will not be available again, and sometimes that loot is close to game breaking in PvP. There are also a lot of cheaters in PvP right now, and there have been for most of the year. Bungies anti-cheat is either ancient and ineffective, or non-existent.On the PvE side, the game just gets stale, and with how much you have to grind before being blessed by RNGesus its noticeable. A power imbalance will never benefit the player; if you can damage enemies that is the most damage you will ever do to them, meanwhile if you are out leveled they will melt you while you merely tickle them. The raids are fun, mostly (damn you Spire of Stars!), but without matchmaking youll need to either try your luck with the LFG forms or the app, or hope you can find a good clan.Circling back around to not respecting your time, with the release of the next expansion, Beyond Light, your guns and armor are now going to have a life span; so all of your work against RNG will be wiped clean with the launch of the annual fall expansion. Bungie has tried to justify this by saying that other MMOs obsolete gear. This is true, but despite their insistence this is not an MMO, and your guns are not stat sticks; each one feels slightly different. They say transmog is coming at some point, so that will help with armor obsolescence at least visually, but youll still need to chase new rolls; and with how resource expensive it is to upgrade armor thats going to be painful.Overall there is a decent game buried under all of the bull, but I dont believe Bungie will ever find it. If a different dev was at the helm this review would likely be different; hell, I think even Rockstar respects player time more, and if youve played GTA Online in the last couple of years you will know what a shocking statement that is.

Even if you didnt like the game a few weeks ago, its worth getting just because of how quickly its improving without Activision trying to screw over the devs. ", "Author": "pixelsBROKEN", "Hours": 86.6}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: June 20, 2020", "Review": "Great game, but i currently (Jun 2020) cant recommend it.Destiny 2 features one of the best gunplay across the FPS games ive played in the past and the available content provides tons of hours of fun, but the developer is taking a couple of pretty horrible turns. If you plan on casually playing it, its a great option, but the more time you spend on it the more you notice just how much content is getting recycled and how often insanely bland things get turned into \"events\". Their \"play the way you want\" changed into a \"play the way we can sustain\" and lately the game simply feels more like work - which really shouldnt be the case.", "Author": "DarkKing", "Hours": 930.9}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: June 7, 2021", "Review": "This review is based on playtime spent using an alternate account:--> https://steamcommunity.com/id/DestinyForFree/Because that account is Limited. follow this link for why:--> https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663In other words, the account Im posting the review with, is NOT the account used for the Review. THIS account has about 90 hours Steam Version and another 400+ hours when D2 was on Battle.NET and I have full knowledge of what the PAID Destiny 2 experience is like.The PURPOSE of this review is to look at the COMPLETELY FREE offering of D2 on Steam, and determine if I would put money into the game based on that Impression.So please respect that \"pay and itll get better\" comments would only make this assessment WORSE.  Notes on Monetization will be AFTER the review and not considered in the score. _ _ OVERVIEW:On the Destiny For Free account I was lazily able to complete all Location activities and \"Story\" content (with a fair amount of bumbling and lollygagging to simulate \"Noob\" indecision and confusion) in under 32 hours.Starting at 1100 Power, I was able to reach a soft cap of 1260 in roughly 4 to 5 hours. Spending all remaining time slowly climbing to 1266.I was unable to access most of the Pinnacle Engram bounties. Instead I was continually presented in-game prompts to purchase additional, individual content expansions.The Crucible and Gambit, Destinys premiere PvP playgrounds, were a frustrating onslaught of meta-enthusiast griefing, obvious hacking, poor matchmaking, near constant teammates disconnecting, and repeatedly being frozen solid to remind you that existence as a free player, is just to be a random, disposable body, filling out a squad so that the match can start. _ _ SCORING:Where Destiny 2 excels with solid gameplay, visual presentation, and voice talent.Where Destiny 2 falters is in the childish/hack dialog, weak story, boring activates, stock NPCs, and cookie-cutter enemy factions.This leaves D2 in a very Middling and Disappointing place:- Grinders and Score-a-holics will love D2 for its End Game bragging rights.- People who enjoy GOOD stories will feel insulted.- People that like varied content and clever mechanics will get easily bored.- People that love Bungie no matter what they do, have already purchased everything.Destiny 2: 100% Free Edition gets a 4 out of 10 - \"Below Average\"I would have no confidence investing money or time in D2 if this was my only impression. _ _ MONITIZATION:If this was 2002, where the digital delivery of content wasnt as prevalent, and the general expectation was to \"pay before you play\" Destiny 2s Free portion would have scored higher as a way to wet a players appetite for more content.However, with the rise of Legit Free-To-Play Games and the ever increasing quality of them: Destiny 2 simply cannot compete with what they have on offer.Destiny 2 Employs both an outdated, overly expensive Paid-Expansion model AND the worst aspects of a Mobile Games premium cash shop.Some might call this \"Pay-to-Win\" but really its more like a \"Pay-to-Skip\" convenience.Simply put, youll just be able to access higher Power faster with the expansions than without.And yet, even while many other competing games offer their entire playable content for free, with fair, if not GENEROUS, cash shops. Destiny 2 relies on their players being willing to overpay, seemingly as if they have no knowledge of games with far better MTX. Id say, in my humble opinion, the reason Destiny 2 seems to survive is based solely on past goodwill built upon the Marathon and the Halo franchises. Bungie seems to set their prices based on prior clout and loyal fans, rather than on the real product D2 currently is or has been. _ _ EDIT:Were I to consider additional aspects like:- community features (or lack thereof).- the community itself (please stop preventing me from activating heroic on Events!).- technical issues (even on a 4th Gen M.2 Sabrent Rocket, load times are BAD).- terrible menu design and delays. - having to use an phone app or DIM for things like loadouts and remote bounties.- token customization of the player character and classes for an \"RPG\".- unnecessarily convoluted and expensive customization of equipment in both looks and function.- and glimmer has no reason to exist as a players resource, given the way players currently use it as a game mechanic (FITE ME!).:the score would have been lowered at least another 2 points.

I seriously couldnt believe that it was true when I booted destiny up again, but they actually removed the majority of the content from the game.   There is no way to access the content, even if you payed for it and own it. Its gone.   As a longtime fan of the series and of Bungie studios it pains me to write this review, but this is where I draw the line.

A little tip from me.", "Author": "Lies", "Hours": 2272.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 13, 2019", "Review": "Ill be honest - coming into Destiny 2, I was highly skeptical. As a former Halo & Bungie fanboy, I was all too aware of the failings of Destiny & Destiny 2 on release, and some of the major flaws of the game. But on recommendations from a few friends last month I opted to try it out and give it a proper go, and I was pleasantly surprised.That said, the game is not very intuitive. I was quite fortunate to have people hold my hand along the way and point things out to me, which is still something I need around a month later. There are also plenty of online resources, but nothing beats having a friend show you the ropes. Im not going to list \"not much fun without friends\" as a con here, because that is just about every multiplayer video game. I also wouldnt say \"A lot more fun with friends.\" either, due to the same reasoning.I started out as a Warlock because I figured they sound cool, and I spent around 2 weeks on that character, I played a lot of Crucible and Gambit specifically with my friends as I learned more about the game. The Crucible is the PvP portion of Destiny 2, with a couple of different modes. The gunplay is fun and exciting, and for the most part (Im looking at you, Titans) it is very balanced and enjoyable. But I think Gambit is one of the true gems in Destiny 2, a PvPvE mode in which you compete with another team of players against an onslaught of mobs, collecting motes to summon a boss, and the team to kill their boss first, wins. All the while teams will send a player to the other to run interference and slow them down. It sounds quite simple but in the experience it can be described as orchestrated chaos, and I love it. There are also the PvE parts of the game in the form of Strikes (Dungeons), Nightfalls (Timed & Scored Strikes), and Raids. I managed to do Leviathan with a group of friends as at that point I did not yet have the latest expansions, and I must say it was truly awful. But after getting Forsaken & Shadowkeep, the older raids definitely feel a lot more fun and I must say they are very challenging, which is refreshing. If I have to be honest I have hardly done much world content, aside from a few public events, because I dont feel the need to unless I want to get some glimmer. So I wont touch on that too much.As a side note, if youre worried about investing all your time into one character only to decide you want to try a different class, dont stress.  I got bored of my Warlock after those 2 weeks and opted to play a Titan instead (if you cant beat them, join them?), and it took me around 6 hours to get to the same gear level as my Warlock. Striker Titan is a lot of fun and suits my playstyle a lot, which I think speaks volumes for the class identity in the game and how there are plenty of options to suit how you want to play.In Summary,Pros:- Very smooth and fun gunplay, with a plethora of different guns to collect and try out.- Varied and fun things to do from PvP, PvE, & even PvPvE!- A lot of different ways to play your class (Although some of these are locked behind expansions & gear pieces)- Multiple ways to progress in the game and grow your character. All game modes reward gear relative to your current light level (Gear score). And the progression feels satisfying.y- Raid content is actually challenging and it feels like an accomplishment when you do manage to complete an encounter.Cons:- The game is not very intuitive and difficult to pick up and play.- The pricing of some of the DLC is excessive, luckily I got Forsaken on sale for around half price, but I think if you want to get into the game and see the price of Forsaken + Shadowkeep, it can be very off putting.- Can require a lot of grinding.- Microtransactions.All in all, if youre looking for a multiplayer shooter with a varied bunch of content to do, give Destiny 2 a try. I wouldnt classify it as a traditional MMO, so dont write it off if thats something youre trying to avoid. Give it a try and see how you feel, maybe youll change your mind like I did.", "Author": "SwingLifeAway", "Hours": 291.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 1, 2020", "Review": "Destiny 2 is overall a very fun game that can be equally as frustrating. As a RPG-FPS, the gunplay is very smooth and satisfying, combined with the various class abilities that not only add to the fun but also give each class a distinct feel. In terms of content, the game is incredibly generous and gives you a ton stuff for free. A great portion of the content is available in the base game, without needing to pay a single cent. Both PvE and PvP feeds into an addicting gameplay loop, whether it be hunting god rolls, grinding exotics, collecting gear and triumphs, or just generally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 around to chill and have fun during the weekend. Theres something for everyone.PvE is best enjoyed with a team, though matchmaking usually takes care of that. Higher difficulty content and raids will need you to grab some friends though. However, PvE can become repetitive if you have put a lot of hours into the game, and I myself am often bored of playing even as a PvE main. PvP is a bloody mess that can be sometimes fun, sometimes rage-inducing, especially with how bonkers the balancing in this game is. Some weapons are ridiculously good in too many situations, like the Recluse and Lord of Wolves (nerfed soon haha get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 shotgun apes). Player classes can also be stupidly unbalanced to the point of making PvP matches turn into a contest of who can become the scummiest sweatlord in a single game. Im looking at you, OEM Strikers, Poledancers and Fission Voidwalkers. Take this as a mild warning before stepping into the Crucible or Gambit.The games story itself is meh with mostly bland characters (Cayde-6 is a bro, of course) and a mostly uninteresting campaign. Something something Cabal on Mars, wasnt too thrilled. The lore however is a different case. Destiny as a franchise has incredible worldbuilding and storytelling that isnt immediately told unless you dig deep into the provided lorebooks (or just watch youtube videos on it). This section is mostly addressed to the few players who might find themselves captivated by Destinys rich lore and spend hours reading/watching the many stories from this world. I know I have.Onto add-on content, the New Light expansion is actually really messy and many new players like myself then got overwhelmed with how many activities the game throws at you with no introduction. Give it time though and itll sort itself out. Probably. This games DLCs (Forsaken and Shadowkeep) are definitely worth the money imo. The activities, exotics and subclasses they give you open up a whole new playground if youre thirsting for more. Play the f2p game first before buying DLCs to judge for yourself though, wouldnt want buyers remorse right?The Destiny community is honestly one of the reasons I enjoy this game so much. Be it content creators, lore scholars, or just players you matched up with, there is a strong sense of community surrounding this game. If youre a solo player looking to do raids/secret quests, you can find other solo players or even veterans willing to help on LFG sites or on discord, to name a few. Its just cool to see a community being this passionate about their game.One important side-note is the constant network issues I and many players have had in this game. The game would sometimes kick you out of an activity or even to the main menu for no apparent reason. Im not a tech person and dont really understand jargon, but the game has a rather low tick rate which can result in a lot of kill trading or delayed kills in PvP. Just be wary of this issue if you are looking to invest a lot of time in Destiny, as it can be a fun killer in many situations.After 500+ hours of playing with cross-save (console pleb), I can say that D2 is a really fun RPG-FPS with many noticeable issues. Despite being loaded with content and having an addicting gameplay loop, it can also be stale and frustrating to play at times. A love-hate relationship is the best term I can use for this game. I would recommend any new players to try out the free base game to get an idea if they would enjoy the game or not. For those not interested, no harm done. For those who are, I welcome you to our ranks. Eyes up, Guardian.tl;drSuper good game that isnt perfect, can have its frustrating moments. Play with friends for max fun, game has great lore for those interested. Play f2p version first before buying DLCs, beware of internet issues.

If you get this game I promise you youll enjoy it as long as youll do every single thing in the game.And thats where the problem starts: Content. If you want to min-max youll need to play this game everyday. You will need to play unfavored content for loot. You dont like PvP? Well too bad, you have to do PvP weekly quests for powerful engram. Youll feel burned out soon enough if you finish every content in the game.Events are a joke to be fair. They look so good yes, the rewards can be decent. However every event is basicly the same: Bounty grind. You grind bounties in event arena. Again and again. Event after event.Also this is the only game that deletes major content by saying \"vaulting\". Major story content like Red War, Curse of Osiris, Warmind and now Forsaken is gone. Destinations (Maps) related to these gone too. Chances are newer content will be gone too. Old raids are gone, old weapons and armors are gone in the name of \"sunsetting\" -a way that failed miserably to stop power creep. Then those old weapons are brought back as new grindable content.In addition to these, Destiny 2 is NOT an MMORPG. The most players you see will be in Tower -Main HUB area. Other than that the most crowded youll get is in 6v6 Iron Banner PvP Event and Raids (6 people). Destiny 2 is a looter shooter. So dont be fooled by its MMORPG tag.

You play as a superpowered guardian (3 classes) and you play different activities to level up and upgrade your gear. Destiny is probably my favorite game franchise at this point. Ive found something to enjoy in each release, started more casually but became much more interested after year 1. With Bungies split from activision and the release of shadowkeep and new light the game is in a great spot. For those that have never played, there is a free version of destiny called new light that includes all the year 1 content and rewards, including-The base game-The curse of osiris DLC-The warmind DLC-Year 1 strike missions-Year 1 Nightfall missions (More difficult)-Year 1 Raids (6 player pinnacle activities)-PVP modes-Gambit which combines PVP and PVE-exotic weapon quests-Secret missions like the whisper, zero hour, and bad juju which are some of my favorite levels ever-Titles and triumphs to chase-9 full planets to explore (Including the moon from shadowkeep-Year 2 activities like forges, gambit prime, and the menagerie (Although I dont think you can get year 2 loot from them)-Seasonal events like iron banner (pvp), festival of the lost (Halloween), the dawning (winter), crimson days (valentines day), the revelry (spring), and solstice of heroes (summer)As for year 3, they have introduced a season pass that allows a free section so if you have new light youll still be getting year 3 content, just not as much as season pass owners.This is an insane amount of free content. However if you end up loving the game and run out of things to chase I highly recommend the forsaken expansion which is now cheaper I believe, it includes-Forsaken campaign-2 maps (with many endgame activities)-The Last Wish Raid-A Dungeon (Harder mission)-4 new strikes(Now includes the annual pass content:)-Forges, gambit prime, reckoning, and the menagerie; with new light you can play these but I believe you need forsaken to get the rewards of which there are many)-tons of exotic questsShadowkeep which just released includes-Shadowkeep campaign-1 new map (The moon)-2 new strikes-The Garden of Salvation Raid-New dungeon-New finishing move emotes-Armor 2.0 update-Many quality of life updates-New pvp maps and modes-new exotic questsDestiny has been through many ups and downs. It has some flaws to make note of. Due to the power of weapons and many exploits, overpowered weapons and abilities are nerfed or adjusted so not all weapons always feel the same. This can make pvp especially frustrating at times, but once they make adjustments it returns to normalcy. There are also microtransactions through the eververse store, but they are purely cosmetic and dont affect gameplay. As for the positives, there is just so much to do. Experienced players often finish the newest content and run out of things to do or feel burnt out but I keep hearing stories of new players who are almost overwhelmed by all the things to do. Dont feel like you have to do everything, Id say just have fun running through the campaigns and go from there whether you prefer pvp or pve or both. The art style and music are and always have been amazing and many of the planets are beautiful to explore. While the destiny community can often be found complaining on reddit about weapon changes and small details, there is still a lot to love about the game and the community often rallies together to show support. Due to the multiplayer, its easy to find players to help you. Im sure as a destiny fanboy Im overlooking a number of flaws, but they honestly dont bother me and I enjoy nearly everything in the game (except getting boss stomped.)

New Light will find themselves thrown into an ocean of quests without any clear direction where to start so you better have a guide, be it a random or a friend. Ive guided my friends and i couldnt believe how badly the game handles new players.Bungo gives off very conflicted emotions, you want to believe they care with amazing trailers, speeches etc. but when you follow game updates/fixes etc. you feel the opposite. Bugs that have been in game for months and years, irrelevant loot (as most of the armor and weapons are garbage, including most of the exotics that are like legendary rarity items in other games, but those in D2 are mostly trash), ridiculous layered RNG and more.Story of the game is all over the place. Every expansion (now called \"season\", same stuff in reality) has its own, very short storyline that is almost completely not related to the others. Around 90% of the story is hidden in the lore tab in triumphs you have to work for, with a new feature - FOMO - cuz after season ends you cant even earn those triumps anymore making the storyline even less relevant, I mean if you can just hide it from ppl who did not get it in time then seasonal story must be 100% irrelevant to the universe.Endgame content like raids is a double edged sword; they are the best content in the game when youre doing it with somewhat familiar ppl that have some abilites to listen, learn and execute mechanics that sounds complicated but are easy in reality. The other edge of said sword is really bad as many ppl rage quit raids cuz of that 1-2 guys dragging the team down. Im mainly doing guided runs and there is way too many ppl on LFG that lack ability to listen or ask when they dont understand sth.Secret missions used to be the rarest and the best content in the game, used to till last week, when the secret mission just had a reward from season pass. Thousands of ppl amazingly working together on a gigantic project, deprived of sleep just to get a reward from season pass while Bungo pretends like everything is fine. Honestly this was the reason i decided to finally drop my opinion on the game. As of writing this Im in top 2% of players when it comes to time spent in game (i started in forsaken, when D2 was 4free on BattleNet), \"spent\" is a very generous word, as \"wasted\" feels more honest.In short great game is being destroyed by FOMO, putting real-money shop as the priority, ignoring bugs/balance, trash loot with ridiculous RNG involved and now disrespecting players time&effort more than ever (with latest puzzle being at the top).Will I keep playing?

But over the course of multiple years the devs proved that they still care more about this game than Blizzard ever would with WoW. Sure it was a rocky road to redemption and we have pretty much seen every possible meta disturbance (looking at you OEM, Handheld and Stompees) and awful decisions regarding both PVE and PVP. Like me, a lot of people grinded through the dark ages of the game when Gambit Prime and Reckoning were a thing and player time wasn\u2019t respected in the slightest (except for pinnacle weapons; may recluse rest in peace). We pulled through and are now playing a game that isn\u2019t perfect at all, but manages to pull you back in no matter how much you seem to hate the game. It is the perfect hate/love relationship simply because of how the community keeps the game fresh and comes up with new builds every single season thanks to the devs providing sandbox updates and unique mods. Just like PVP, PVE also provides a challenge for every type of player. Your loadout, size of the fireteam (even solo play), and choice of difficulty provide a gameplay loop that I haven\u2019t seen in a other game so far. Destiny is unique in the fact that it\u2019s not only a really vast interconnected game when it comes to gameplay but if you are willing to dig deeper, the lore will blow your mind. Now this may sound scary for people who have never dabbled with MMO like looter shooters but you don\u2019t have to take part in every aspect of the game, although I would recommend doing so if you have the time. Some players have never experienced raids at all and they are missing out big time. The community is very accepting of new players and is always ready to teach the newcomers. There is no reason to be afraid of the unknown in the game. The Destiny LFG Server will make your life very easy in case you are lost in the game and don\u2019t know what to do. Now this comes from a player who is definitely addicted to this game and the 2000+ hours logged on steam are not even close to my actual time spent in game. There are 4000 more hours that I have spent across D1 and D2 on Playstation. Every single second was worth it and there will be a lot more to come.

Let me begin with the positives with the game before I go off the rails. This game feels great to play. Gun play is great due to the presence of what is known as bullet magnetism, which bends bullets to your targets, making guns feel crispy, as it is more commonly referred to. Movement is great too. Ever wanted to be a tank with a jetpack? Destiny 2 has it. Destiny 2 is a great game to play with friends. BUTAs CammyCakes, a popular Destiny 2 PvP streamer, said before, Destiny is more like a party game you play with friends. In the PvP scene, the game is all about using the 3 or 4 most broken things you can find, unless you are a great PvP player who can make any gun and build work wonders anywhere. In PvE, the developers just released a new patch that made the skill gap in this game so small that if you just watch some videos on YouTube, youre basically set to kill any boss and clear any content in this game easily, unless you are underlevelled of course.Game developers have no idea what they are doing. Instead of fixing actual problems such as rampant hacking in PvP or content more stale than a breadstick left out for 3 years, they decide to fix minor things that have no impact on the greater community, namely, speedrunning techniques. Do these techniques break the game? No. They make it interesting for highly-skilled players to master and use in the game. Ignoring these targeted nerfs to speedrunning, the game is highly stale with no real content to do anymore. Difficult content for the developers is basically only having enemies hit harder and your weapons hit for peanuts. No real challenge outside of challenges made by the players themselves.The Battle Pass-esque levelling system for every season/expansion just promotes fear of missing out on cosmetics and maybe one or two viable weapons. It promotes no-life-ing in a cave, both in-game as well as in real life, for the entire season to obtain experience to level up the battle pass. ONE mundane bounty such as getting an arbitrary number auto-rifle kills, gives more experience than the pinnacle end-game PvE activity in the entire game, namely the 7 raids that the game offers. Furthermore, content is always recycled every season and there has not been anything new offered.Ive spent over a thousand hours slogging through the stale waters of this game, stale enough to breed a million mosquitoes, but today, this new season, Season of the Worthy, was the last straw for me, as well as many dedicated players. As many people have already aptly named it, way before the season was released, the season should be more accurately named Season of the Worthless, as you know, this game is pretty much worthless now.", "Author": "Catt", "Hours": 1370.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: September 20, 2020", "Review": "\u1d35 \u1d47\u1d52\u1d58\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49 \u1d49\u02e3\u1d56\u1d43\u207f\u02e2\u2071\u1d52\u207f\u02e2 \u1d43\u207f\u1d48 \u02e2\u1d57\u1d52\u1d56\u1d56\u1d49\u1d48 \u1d56\u02e1\u1d43\u02b8\u2071\u207f\u1d4d/10", "Author": "`will", "Hours": 84.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 12, 2021", "Review": "super poggers tbh", "Author": "Liv", "Hours": 4872.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 31", "Review": "Destiny 2 is great.+ Great Soundtrack+ Great Scenery+ Satisfying Game-play+ Rewarding Game-play- Can be a bit of a grind- Can get boring if you play aloneThis game shines when you have a clan to play with, do raids with, do GMs with, do the story with.Sharing the experiences with friends is what makes Destiny 2 special.

Each aspect, ranging from movement, gunplay, abilities, environment, sound, design are incredibly well polished and have a touch of brilliance to it. That being said, let\u2019s dive into some details.Story Destiny 2 is a direct successor to the console game Destiny. The Black Garden has been discovered, Crota and Oryx have been slain, SIVA was released and contained.Destiny 2 initially began with our guardian returning to the tower to find it under siege by an alien race called the Cabal. We make our way, fighting through the tower and make our way to the Red Legion command ship to take out the cabal leader. However, we are drained off our powers in the process and tossed off the ship. This campaign was a story of us reuniting the guardian leadership called vanguard, slowly regaining our powers, and fighting the cabal. However, with the release of Beyond Light DLC, the earlier stories were wiped from the game, and the start of destiny 2 was instead replaced by the same mission that was played in the start of destiny. To me, the story of destiny 2 was always a mixed bag. As someone new to the destiny franchise, Red War kept me hooked on as I was excited to learn about the enemy races, the vanguard and bringing down the antagonist who tried to steal our powers. However, when it comes to Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLCs, the story was never engaging. I never felt a real threat, or any emotional connection to what was happening. That all took a turn in Forsaken DLC, when Bungie killed off one of the most fan favorite characters. Forsaken had an amazing story behind it, and it really created an emotional draw to play through it. Shadowkeep played a huge part in the story of Destiny to come, as it laid down the foundations for the current DLC, Beyond Light. Gameplay Destiny 2 has the classic MMO experience, with the player receiving the choice between three classes - Hunter, Warlock and Titan. Each class has 4 elemental subclasses \u2013 Void, Arc, Solar and Stasis. Each subclass has 3 further trees, each changing the type of grenade, melee, and the super ability. Each class has two unique class abilities, the hunter receiving two different dodges, warlock receiving two different healing/buffing rifts, and the titans having two types of barricades. The primary PvE content apart from the story missions, were 3 player co-op activities called strikes. Strikes were usually new content, but what really put me off at times was the fact that many of the strikes were just the story missions. For example, the final mission of the Warmind DLC, was put up as a strike, which in my opinion was not a good move, considering the game has a mode called Daily Heroic Mission, which would take one story mission each day, and make it available for play at a higher difficulty. The PvP mode was in an arena called the Crucible, which had a good lore set behind it. However, the mode itself was always surrounded in a lot of disapprovals. The anti-cheat is almost nonexistent, with people rampantly cheating without any consequences. However, in the recent months, Bungie has been hammering down on cheats more effectively, having presented the primary cheat distributor with a cease and desist, and working on the anti-cheat system on the backend. PvP was often shrouded in a lot of disappointment, because to balance the sandbox, a lot of nerfs were dished out, but that also resulted in nerfs to the PvE sandbox, which a lot of players were disappointed about.The pi\u00e8ce de resistance of the destiny franchise were the raids. No game that has attempted raids had ever come in contest of the destiny raids. Raids were 6 player co-op activities, which were the pinnacle of destiny challenges. These activities consist of some of the most challenging puzzles, bosses, and mechanics. Each raid on launch, is accompanied by a world\u2019s first raid race, and a day 1 raid clear challenge. These challenges, in my opinion are some of the best challenges you can try to compete in destiny. I personally took part in the raid race for Deep Stone Crypt (the newest raid), and it was an unforgettable experience. The sense of achievement after brainstorming challenges, and perfecting mechanics for over 12 hours at a stretch was unparalleled in terms of gaming experiences. GunplayDestiny 2, being an FPS game, relies heavily around how the gunplay is, and this is an aspect that they have absolutely nailed. The gunplay, and the \u2018pop\u2019 from enemies dying feel immensely satisfying. There is always a type of gun for any player out there, comprising of auto-rifles, submachine guns, hand cannons, scout rifles, sniper rifles, swords, fusion rifles, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, sidearms and more. The guns rely on a perk pool, which distinguishes one gun from the other. Many guns belong to the rarity class called \u2018Exotic\u2019, and have special intrinsic perks, all to themselves which help make the gun unique. The perk system is really well defined, and is a huge part of the satisfying user experience that this game delivers.GraphicsDestiny 2 has stunning visuals, and surprisingly low technical requirements for the graphics it presents you with. The game has a beautiful icy world in Europa, where you can see a beautiful Jovian Eclipse if you\u2019re patient enough. It has wastelands in the cosmodrome, which captures the post-apocalyptic theme very well. In almost every situation, destiny has the perfect atmosphere, which really captures your attention and completely engrosses you in the gameplay. Scary hive consumed depths of the moon have shadows of hive thresh crawling over the walls, the paths near the Scarlet keep completely engulfed by nightmares. The planet Titan has immeasurable amounts of methane all around, and if you\u2019re brave enough to go through the depths of the facility, you could see the silhouette of the monsters that lurked in it. Earth had the reminiscence of the golden age, as it is called in destiny. Broken technology spewed all around the different explorable zones made up a lot of the aesthetics of the cosmodrome. AudioNo matter the state of destiny, whether the game is struggling in content or not, one thing that is always top tier was the music in destiny. This game has some of the most amazing soundtracks ever created. Michael Salvatori often outdid himself with creation of music like \u2018Deep Stone Lullaby\u2019 (my personal favorite) and \u2018Journey\u2019. Layered sound was a method that was heavily utilized in this game, to create perfect atmospheres, no matter the situation. The audio really made you feel strong when it should have, made you feel loss when it should, made you feel proud when it should, and everything in between. ConclusionWhile destiny 2 is not perfect, it still cemented itself as one of my all-time favorite games. There is always something engaging to do in the game, and there is always something for you, no matter your interests. The game has an outstanding community management team behind it, that listens to their crowd, and implements the changes they desire. For me, this game is the perfect live service looter-shooter, and no game would ever come close to it. I would give this game a solid 9/10.", "Author": "LowkiiDerp", "Hours": 1997.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: August 18, 2021", "Review": "Just try it, you might get addicted.", "Author": "Darious Senju", "Hours": 2635.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: April 29, 2021", "Review": "It aint even good... but it has stolen my life.", "Author": "SGT.

There wasn\u2019t really a reason to play anymore, so I didn\u2019t.I kept an ear out during the first year of D2. Curse of Osiris landed with a massive thud, Warmind was better received but still didn\u2019t sound like enough. Then towards the end of D2Y1, they had the Solstice of Heroes event, and I thought \u201cWhat the heck, let\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d The event was built around a pretty hefty grind/chase through all of the activities in the game to get some sweet-ass armor. I liked having a long-term goal to work on. I liked having a reason to play.That right there is the key phrase: a reason to play. Because I enjoyed Solstice, I ended up buying Forsaken, and since then, for the entire past \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 year, I have played nothing but Destiny 2. Between Forsaken and the Season Pass, there has always a reason to play. Maybe it\u2019s new lore drops in the Dreaming City. Maybe it\u2019s Iron Banner. Maybe it\u2019s a surprise exotic quest like Zero Hour. Maybe it\u2019s weekly raid challenges to get more chances at the best gear. Maybe it\u2019s a new Heroic Menagerie boss that I want to down flawlessly to get closer to the Shadow Title. Maybe it\u2019s grinding the Forges in search of that elusive Feeding Frenzy/Kill Clip Blast Furnace. Maybe there\u2019s some sweet-ass ship in Eververse this week only and I want to build up some bright dust to buy it. Maybe there\u2019s a new Gambit Prime map. Maybe \u201cLake of Shadows\u201d is the Nightfall this week and I\u2019m looking for a well-rolled Militia\u2019s Birthright. Visions of the Nine. The Vanguard/Drifter Loyalty Quest. Pinnacle Weapons. The Mars Community Event. Reckoning Bosses are dropping Sole Survivor this week. Escalation Protocol boss is dropping the Ikelos Shotgun this week. The Shattered Throne is open.

This week\u2019s Ascendant Challenge has the last egg I need to get that awesome Taken Sparrow.For an entire year, this game has held me hostage because there is always a reason to play. There is always something to do. Only twice, in the last 365 days, have I logged in, done my Gunsmith Dailies, then sat there and said \u201cWow, I don\u2019t have anything to do in Destiny today.\u201d Once was because I had already completed everything I wanted to in Iron Banner that week, and once was six days before Shadowkeep when I had completed all of my prep (stocking bounties, planetary mats, upgrade mats, etc). There\u2019s plenty of other stuff I could talk about. The gunplay is second to none, the music is fantastic, and if you\u2019re willing to dive deep into the lore it\u2019s friggin\u2019 amazing\u2026 but honestly, all of that is secondary.

You start in the middle of the story, characters talk to you, plot threads are being talked about without any context, because they assume the player already knows the context?Thats EXACTLY what the start of Destiny 2 is like now. Even coming from a veteran who played this game before any expansions. I remember building my character up myself, gaining XP to increase my main level, increasing my light level from 0 to 300, and then spending hours with my friends doing endgame raids to get those 330 items. I got my light level to around 328 before I stopped playing. I was actually excited to get back in and start playing this again when I heard it was moving to Steam. I made sure to link my accounts to preserve my save data, mostly for archival purposes/nostalgia. But when I get in-game, I noticed both my old characters, and every new character I made would start at light level 750? And the system of levelling up and acquiring new abilities as you progress had also been cut, you get everything from the start now. I thought this was a \"reward\" for returning players or something, but then when I started a new character, they had all the abilities unlocked, started at light 750. If light level 750 is effectively 0; just make it 0.Far from feeling encouraged by my gear suddenly being boosted, I felt undermined. I had worked hard to get my items to level 328. Now theyre 750, and 750 is the new 0. I would actually prefer if it just said 0; because thats what it is. At least then I could feel like I was actually starting my character from the bottom. I would actually prefer to play the game as it was before this \"New Light\" starting area was introduced. The Red War campaign did a much better job of introducing the characters, the mechanics, the story, the lore, the gameplay, the abilities and the planets especially. The different planets you visit in the game used to be unlocked through story progression, which worked fine, youd spend a short amount of time on each world before moving on to the next, enough to get familiar with the layout of each world but not enough that itd become repetitive. You knew where to go if you wanted to come back and grind for something later. Now the worlds are unlocked for new players simply by earning enough XP. So now you dont have any context as to *why* you can now go to a different planet, you just can.TL;DR: This game used to be better.

Teaching raids as a sherpa has turned this game into a passion for me, allowing me to share my love of raiding with the rest of the community. However, I have to say that I am deeply disappointed with how far the game has fallen in recent months. The Destiny Content Vault removed much of the content in the game and has essentially turned the F2P version of the game into a demo. Theres almost no real content for F2P players to enjoy, and the Forsaken and Shadowkeep DLCs have had most of their content removed or sunset. Beyond Light is the only part of the game that is worth playing at the moment but that deserves its own review. I just cant recommend the base version of this game to anyone who wants to invest a lot of their time into it. The gameplay loop consists of running the playlist activities (strikes, crucible, gambit) over and over again without any meaningful progression other than increasing your power level. The gunplay and abilities are all really cool and feel great to play with, but besides that, theres no meaningful content to maintain continued interest in the game.

This falls content drop was fairly minor compared. A raid, a pretty large new patrol zone (returning from destiny 1), (another) new horde mode, a fair few new armour pieces and weapons, and an alright (i guess?) storyline (that ends on a cliff hanger and has yet to be developed upon after 8 months).The most recent season:It felt like it was put together in 2 weeks. For the low low price of \u00a310 of in game currency you get a story 2 cutscenes long, thrilling seasonal objectives which are nothing short of a tragic drudge through monotonous menial gameplay, a season pass that gives you access to 4 new weapons, some materials and a few ornaments. The usual spring seasonal event of through the roof boosted ability energy regen with a custom arena was replaced with with a boring monotonous daily grind of simple objectives in gameplay that youd already be doing. Most of the fashion in destiny is locked behind the notorous \"Eververse\" store that uses 2 premium currencies. 1 is ONLY purchaseable for real money, the other is only obtainable as a CHANCE every 5-10 levels or in tiny amounts every week from the in game bounty system.Trials:The clip of Frostbolt (one of the most famous destiny 2 PvP streamers) getting spawn killed by an invincible player firing an RPG like its a minigun speaks for itself.The gameplay:One of the most interesting and fun sandboxes for a looter shooter Ive seen. The way weapons and abilities feel is genuinely incredible. The problem is that the number of times you are forced to repeat the same activities over and over to make any progress towards \"Light Level\" and the overpowered (and therfore necessary end game content) pinnicle guns and armour a living hell. I hope you like logistics management games because the way bungie forcies bounties down your throat as the only way of leveling up and completing objectives will make you a master of inventory management and efficiency. There is NO incentive (and in some cases availability) to repeat old content from previous years. There are now 6 raids, 20+ adventures, 7 important seasonal activities (nightfall Strike activities, shattered throne dungeon, Escalation Protocol Horde Mode, Black Armoury Weapon Forges, The Reckoning Horde Mode and The Menagerie Raid-Like Activity) and 3 patrol zones that are completely obselete except to run through once to pick up the guns and armour for collections (Which will also soon be useless due to  WEAPON RETIREMENT  IN A LOOTER SHOOTER).The developers at bungie have shown time and time again that they only care about keeping the in game microtransaction store fully stocked and pumping out the absolute minimum the can get away with in terms of content. This has happened for several seasons (each 3 months long) in a row. And Spoiler: The next season doesnt look to be any better. some of the points I have mentioned are going to be addressed in 4 months times when they release  another  DLC/Season combo where you have to purchase both to get the new content.I run my own clan of 80 people and Im struggling to make excuses to myself for why im playing this game. Its not fun. Its a boring grind to get all your weekly objectives and bounties down so youre not left behind when content is removed. The only reason I can think of why Im still playing is that ive put so much time into this game that i dont want to face the realisation that Ive lost over a thousand hours of my life to a game that has at every turn done everything it can to force me to stop playing.tldr: dont buy this game unless you want to experience the exact feeling having your nuts in a vice grip and slowly turning the screw because theres nothing else to do==========2020==========i want to go back this is so much worse i want to go back so badCompared to when I wrote this review, 3/4 of all available weapons are useless, 4 planets are gone completely, 5 raids are gone completely, 1 dungeon has been shelved, the only 2 activities with any kind of customiseable loot are gone completely, 6 strikes are gone completely, multiple PVP maps are gone completely.The DLC is pretty fun. Nice story, all 5 currently available new weapons are pretty fun. The new ability set is pretty fun (if extremely polarizing in PvP).The season is terrible. the activity consists of a single boss fight. Thats it. One boss fight that takes all of 30 seconds. but wait, to even HAVE the privilege of doing that single 30 second boss fight you have to spend over half an hour doing content that hasnt been updated in over a year, in the LEAST fun way possible. You are forced to compete with randomly matched teammates for kills to stand any hope of doing more than 2 of the new seasonal activities an hour.Fire Luke Smith.", "Author": "Magic Bean Dealer", "Hours": 1998.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 17, 2019", "Review": "I got the game for free since it was still in Battle.net, but I only started on Steam when the game was officially migrated to there.

I cant say with confidence that the game is going to continue to improve, and all the removed content that people paid for is still gone, so this review is going to stay negative for now - its better now than it was when I quit, but considering that was the worst state the game has ever been in, that isnt saying much.  Its a far cry from what it was in the heyday of Forsaken and I still cant recommend anyone sink in time and money unless you really feel the need for a shlooter in this vein.---This game is headed in a bad, bad direction.  New players as of this or next season might not see much wrong, but players who have years of investment in this game are being betrayed, and the excuses are flimsy garbage.Ive played this game since launch, bought every expansion, sunk countless hours into bnet, and finally quit during season of the undying because the game was just getting grindier and grindier, more and more layers of long, abstract grinds for underwhelming, abstract rewards.  I decided to start playing again just before Season of Arrivals hit, to see what the current state of the game is like.  When Arrivals dropped, I was pleased and impressed.  The story gears were finally turning.  A lot of my issues with task overwhelm were addressed or at least mitigated.  I got invested again.That was a mistake.Since Arrivals launch, Bungie has been elaborating piece by piece on the destiny content vault and gear sunsetting systems.  The first is an ill-concieved act of desperation, butchering old content out of the game (content that players paid for) in order to make room for new stuff because the engine is bloated garbage thats sick on a level too deep for them to fix.  But lets give them the benefit of the doubt, most of that old stuff is simply not played, and maybe there really is no way to fix the deeper problems with the game, so things like locations and raids need to be cycled in and out of the game as seasons pass.  Just a fact of life.Then theres the next thing.  Gear sunsetting is an act of pure, unadulterated cruelty to PVE players.  Anyone who has any non-exotic piece of gear from before Arrivals they love and adore: get ready to say goodbye, because they are hard-capped at the max light level for Season of Arrivals.  If you want to continue improving your light level next season, which will be necessary for new content, you will need to use new gear, or gear from Arrivals.  The gear is still in the game.  The gear is still equippable.  It is just forcibly being rendered useless.  As years have passed, Bungie has steadily increased the amount of work needed to masterwork items you like - so that god roll weapon from last season you masterworked because you love?  That old raid gun you worked your ass off for?  \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, time to replace it.  There is no sane justification for this past we want to force players to use the new stuff and upgrade their gear all over again.  It is a shallow, transparent attempt to force engagement metrics up by making you abandon gear youve already invested in and invest in something else.It is disrespectful to the players time, it is disrespectful to the players invested money, it is disrespectful to the *player*, it is disrespectful to the game itself - why would you sink that much investment into a piece of gear that will be intentionally taken from you?Regardless I cant support the decisions Bungie are in the process of making for the games future.  If gear sunsetting gets canned then maybe Ill give it another go.

Its got elements that I do like and is one of the few mainstream looter-shooters on the market currently, alongside Borderlands and Warframe.  Between games like SqEnixs Avengers and Warframe, this game does have the least amount of grindy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.  On top of that, it does have some incredibly good gunplay and the mobility does feel liberating to say the very least.  And while the dialogue does leave much to be desired, the potential story on display here is probably the best youd expect from Bungie.  Even during their prime with Halo, Bungies stories were largely bolstered by good presentation rather than coherent storytelling.All that said, the game is on pretty uneven ground as it is.  Bungie as a developer has some pretty skewed understanding of what constitutes good game balance and a good loot cycle.  They judge need for balance based on very surface-level values such as use-rate rather than DPS or the number of encounters certain weapon archetypes are good for.  Though they have recently announced rolling back of gear sunsetting, a mechanic which effectively put a year-long expiration date on most legendary gear, its still a mechanic they shouldve experimented further with rather than announce it and begin implementing it the season after (measure twice, cut once).  Furthermore, Bungies track record for making stupid decisions had largely marred my faith in the company to continue maintaining a well balanced sandbox (weapons like recluse, mountaintop, and revoker come to mind...).  Finally, unless you plan on putting down cash into this game, theres not much to offer.  The F2P experience is pretty bare-bones.  Youve got light PVE content, PVP, PVEVP, a dungeon, and the patrol zones.  You dont have the raids, the campaigns, the other dungeons, many of the exotics, the seasonal content (which is drier than sand), and generally speaking most of the end-game content.Again, its a mixed bag and one that is much more enjoyable with a clan and/or friends.Pros:-The art/music design teams are carrying this game.  Its absolutely gorgeous.-Gameplay is solid.  For the most part.  More on that in a bit.-Great community.  The people here are something else.-The content is rewarding when the chances actually get something to drop for you.  Sort of.-The abilities are pretty cathartic in nature.  Theres just something about jumping miles into the air and dunking on some poor shmuck with a rocket launcher/sniper rifle/shotgun/grenade launcher/grenade ability/melee ability.-Its a basic power fantasy.  Its the McDonalds of power trips.  Its cheap, quick, and itll get it done.  Anything much more meaningful and you might want to look somewhere else.-Its one of the few looter-shooters on the market.  Its kinda allowed to get away with some of its \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.Cons:-Bungie.  Ive already laid out my reasoning and I dont think I need to explain much further.-The balance.  Dear God, stasis was a mistake.  Especially in PVP.-The worst examples of showing-not-telling Ive seen in a game.  Not as bad as the Tomb Raider Reboot, but still pretty bad.  And the stakes couldnt feel any lower.-Seasonal content.  I get that Bungie is trying to stretch cheaper content over the span of a year and that theres not much they can do to make this sort of activity more enticing or less banal, but thats just a sign that its time to go back to the drawing board.-Patrol zones.  The vistas in the patrol zones are pretty, but thats really it.  They feel dead and lifeless after enough exposure.  Maybe thats the point seeing that most of these locations are a post-apocalyptic fantasy world with a sci-fi worlds skin, but there could be some elements that at least make the world feel lived-in.-Map design.  Much of the map design, especially for boss arenas, is designed with abilities in mind.  Its possible that Bungie is trying to break the mold of hugging cover like a significant other as a means of avoiding taking damage.  This is possible.  Doom has been doing this with mobility.  That said, it turns a lot of boss fights into a cheap, meaningless prayer for RNG to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 over the AIs already poor decision-making.-Glitches are few and far between, but good lord, a good portion of the glitches in this game are game-breaking to say the very least.-In essence, this game isnt too meaningfully difficult.  Sure, the values are adjusted so that enemies are tankier/you melt faster, but thats just the basics.  Theres little deviation in what equipment youll be running, what gun youll be running, and what mods youll be running except for whats been chosen at random for the season to be central to the meta.-PVP.  If you want an arena shooter with less \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, its probably better to just go back to playing CoD or Halo.  Stick with the basics.5.5/10  I really want to like this game.  From my time with the Borderlands franchise, I can definitely say this game has the aspects I want from a looter shooter.

Bungie will mess up, and then they will show up. They know how to make a good game. Whether it be the beautiful skyboxes, the fierce battle between your fireteam and a raid boss, or the adrenaline rush when you clutch a 1v3 in the crucible, there are always amazing moments to have.            Bungies franchise is by no means perfect, but I in no way can say it isnt enjoyable. The story is unique and it shows they spent a good amount of time planning it out. The immersive experience in the base story was amazing, meeting new characters and reconnecting with old ones is amazing. We get to watch these characters develop and adapt to the troubles they face. I dont want to spoil the story for new player, so I will leave it at this, the story is something you wont want to miss.             Once all of the story is out of the way, the path towards endgame begins. There is so much to chase in the world of Destiny that there is never nothing to do. It may be tedious farming for the same weapon over and over, but it is SO rewarding when you finally get that god roll weapon you have been farming hours for.               You dont want to chase a weapon? Dont worry, there is so much more you can do! You and a fireteam of three could head into the Trials of Osiris, battling to reach the end to open up that chest in the lighthouse after defeating 7 other fireteams in a row.              You dont like crucible? Dont worry, there is something for you too! Going into the depths of the dungeons with two other guardians, you will face difficulty straight in the face and you will come out victorious. Whether it be in the mysterious Dreaming City, or the evil caverns of the Moon. It is an experience to enjoy! The best feeling, is going into the depths of the Pit of Heresy, and coming out victorious after defeating every enemy as a one guardian army.                There is something for everyone. And trust me, the game may be one hell of a roller coaster sometimes, but it will always be here. If you dont enjoy the game at some point, take that break from Destiny that you think you need. The game will be here when you feel like it is worth it to play. Dont force yourself to play something you dont enjoy.               Gaming is something you should look forward to. And as of right now, I look forward to playing Destiny.Edit: The game is in an odd state, with the withdrawal of a greater majority of content it is hard.

This is a game, where the goal is to complete your collection of loot, and optionally your achievements. The intended goal is not to complete the story, and real max player and gear level. In that sense the game would not be worth the price tag it initially had before going Free to Play, nor the expansions and season pass/DLCs available to further progress the game. This game is a looter shooter, your goal is collect and get your hand on all weapons and armour available in the game, the quest and amount of time you spend doing this, in this game, and other looter shooters, is where the price tag comes into place.Price Tag - Is the game worth it?This is not an easy question to answer, but I will break it down to a few types of playstyles.The player that completes the main storyIf youre the type of player that just complete the main story, you will find that your adventure ends soon after you have started it. This is not the type of game where the main story is the peak of the game. If youre looking for a game with a long story, that takes you through the life and journey of the main character, and dont care about the side missions and end game content, Im afraid this game might not be for you. The main story ends fairly quickly, and if you want to progress the main story of the expansions and DLCs, those price tags may sound a bit overwhelming, and that is understandable.The player that completes main story and side storySimilar to the previous perspective, this is the type of player that prefer the main story, but also plays side story because it adds to the main story. This could also make the game short, but should make the price tag more feasible, and would also be a longer experience or playtime. I would still stand strong in saying that if you dont like the idea of collecting all the loot, this might still not be for you. But in this case it depends how strong you stand for only doing the main and side story.The player that complete the whole game contentThis is where you find your spot. The player that when all main and main side story missions are done, proceed to do the rest of the game, to have everything on 100% completion. In this case, you have found the sweet spot. This game, has so much extra content to offer, if you also have a job or study, you wont have enough time to complete your current content, before a new expansion or DLC is released, which DLC/Season wise is every 3 months, and expansion wise every 1 year/12 months. In this case, I would say, yes, its worth it. But only if your personal objective is to complete all the weapon quests, and you know that is what you enjoy doing.Gameplay - What does the game offer?As stated before, this game has a main story, and quite a few side stories. After you have completed all of that, you will complete quests for every weapon, but theres also dungeons, raids, strikes. Theres also PvP for people who enjoy that, which includes Crucible - Your traditional PvP with various gamemodes, like capture the flag (hero of the hill style) or team deathmatch (called Clash), but also experimental modes - and also Gambit - PvP mixed with PvE, where both teams have their own arena, kill mobs to collect motes, which you bank to summon a boss, which you kill to win the round -. Each of these features also offers bounties, which when completed grant rewards for said subject and also xp, for the current season pass level.So what does each of these features offer?MainThe story is fairly short, but thats not something I would judge as bad. With all the content this game has to offer, the missions and main stories shouldnt really be too long. Having a lot of playing to do each week, with the game resetting weekly events on tuesdays every week, longer missions does get a bit tedious. Id say as a new player, each main story would take around 3 - 6 hours, and each side story 30 minutes - 1.5 hours, each single mission taking 5 - 15 minutes. This is fair I would say, for a game like this.LoreIf you ever played or heard of the story in Destiny 1, you will know that from the start, there wasnt a lot of straight up story telling. In Destiny, you play as a Guardian, which has a small robot figure by your side referenced as \"ghost\". This ghost provides you with \"The Light\", given by the traveller, which is our god in the Destiny universe. The light allows the guardians to get resurrected, and the Ghost having access to the light is what gives us this ability. This is very much talked about in the base games main story called The Red War. Back to what I was saying, the story telling and lore presentation in Destiny 1, was very obscure, the developers made it so you interacted with various findings in the world, letting the ghost know to scan the environment, telling you what it finds, and thus giving you a sense of the lore in the game. This is very much embraced in Destiny 1 and further more in Destiny 2. If you want to know about the Lore, interact with everything you come across. (meta: You can know lore data is available where you are by a ghost icon appearing in the corner when youre in proximity)End Game ContentThe end game has a lot more to offer than I can fit in a single review without making it way longer than it already is. But without going too much into it, the main key features include but not limited to Weapon quests, Strikes, PvP and Lore.Lore I mentioned in the last section. But weapon quests on the other hand, is basically like a card you have in a quest tab. it could involve doing a side mission, to killing various mobs or other guardians with different types of weapons. Please note theres also 3 elemental types in this game, Void, Solar and Arc, and some quests could involve killing with weapons limited to one or more of these weapon types. Theres also strikes, which is basically like Dungeons in games like World of Warcraft. Lastly theres PvP, which I will cover in the next section.PvPThe PvP mechanics in this game, is not the usual, well polished PvP you find in most other games. Its sloppy, laggy and sometimes frustrating and punishing. But before you ditch the game because youre a huge fan of the PvP aspect of games. Know this mechanic, is partially embraced by the developers. It allows you to have stalemate, something which does not happen in a lot of other games Ive played. Basically whenever you kill someone, there might be a slight delay from when you hit them till you take damage. This means you could hit them, then even though they should have died, they get to stab you back, getting you both killed in the process. But dont get me wrong, Im not complaining. Seeing this as a part of the design, I have to say, if you know about this, you learn to play with this in mind, and it actually makes it more interesting.SummarySo this game is hard to summarise. If youre the type of person that only does main story, or even side story, but doesnt go further, the price label is sadly too high for you I would say. But if you like games that takes time to fully complete 100%, and want quantity of content for the price label, and optionally also enjoy other looter shooter, this is a good game for you. But be prepared every expansion cost around 35\u20ac and each season cost 10\u20ac.On a more personal note.

Such a low number Im sure, but Im a noob player with white gear after all, cant wait to get some nice equipment and level ups. Also wondering if this game has skills trees or talents and stuff like that. I want to be a badass tank and protect my fellow guardians.Directing the player seems a bit random but this \"New Light\" questline tells me to go to the EDZ and increase my power level. Starting on destroyed earth sounds cool and I cant wait to learn what happened in the story. Also, theres this sniper guy with the gentleman voice of Balthier from FFXII and hes talking to me all the time which is cool (I really like Balthier, went so far as to imagine him standing up there in the clock tower supporting me with a machinist gun). Some priest of Sigmar reject also sent me to the crucible where I did 2 matches and immediately decided that the PvP in this game isnt for me, but thats fine. After a few public events and the like, Im starting to wonder when/how the story starts and I look some stuff up online.Oh, so power level 750 is actually really really REALLY high and meant to make the new content immediately accessible?

I really love the graphics, music and gunplay, but even after a few hours Im asking myself what else the game has to offer, you know some downtime from the fighting and interacting with players outside of the combat, but I also couldnt find any stuff like that.If you only care about the loot progression with nice gunplay, youll probably enjoy this game since theres a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ton to shoot, although \"the loop\" seems a bit too repetitive, even for a looter shooter. Aside from the gear there hardly seem to be any RPG and party role mechanics which give the players a chance to compliment each other and set the classes apart. If you want to take it slow, be immersed into a cool sci-fi world, explore the story, areas and progression with something of at least resembling a common thread, youll probably be lost and disappointed.", "Author": "retrosic", "Hours": 8.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: September 17, 2021", "Review": "I have played this game for nearly a hundred hours as of writing this review, and I am simply impressed at how much of a massive improvement this is over the first game. I used to play Destiny 1 on and off, and ever since it launched it was a huge disappointment for me. Bungie had promised a much more lively and interesting world, and all we really got was bare bones content, a story so dull as dish water you could probably fall sound asleep to it, and DLC up the wazoo where the base games content should have been.While the game certainly expects you to pay, as a free to play player I have been able to access a surprising amount of content just running hobo mode throughout the game. Here are my impressions:Pros:+ Maps are much larger and contain a lot more variety with so much more to look at as well. A huge improvement over the sliver of land Destiny 1 had you spawn from one end or the other.+ Art design, sound design, and music genuinely could not be any better.+ Gunplay is pretty much the same with some small changes here and there. Its still very satisfying to play, and even more satisfying to try out different unique guns to mix up your play style regardless of class.+ The gameplay loop is fun and addicting, really, if you enjoyed Borderlands and looking for better loot in those games then you will enjoy this.+ Enemies are no where near as ridiculously spongy as Destiny 1s, and I believe the mob to player balance is exactly where it should be. Youre strong but youre not over powered, and bosses wont just eat all of your ammunition for 2 hours.+ The game is well optimized and there have only been a handful of glitches I have encountered, and in my 98 hours of playing I have only encountered one game crash.+ Playing this game with friends is not only the optimal way to play to get the most out of this game, I would argue it is the only way to play this game. Its so much more fun to play with people you know than randoms.+ For a free to play game Im impressed with how much I am allowed to get away with. Full access to PVP, Gambit, Strikes, Raids, Nightfalls, all 7 locations currently available in the game, the ability to change your armors skin with a simple resource you can earn towards, unlocking dyes, exotic equipment, really if this were any other MMO you would be asked to pay for the right to breathe air but this game has been very enjoyable even without the DLC.Cons:- The story is still dull as dish water, only with the added annoyance that if you werent there for previous story content you simply dont get to be a part of it. So characters are going to be referring to a lot of stuff you obviously werent there for and you wont have a clue, nor can you really revisit all previous content like Guild Wars 2. The story is already weak, but it takes you out of the experience even more by dropping you into things without context.- PVP, even to people outside of Destinys atmosphere, is just a meme. Instant death, no semblance of balance or care, and if youre a PVE focused player tough \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 because in order to complete all your bounties you have to play Crucible at some point. On the bright side there is Gambit which is a nice middle ground between PVE and PVP, so you can just hide behind people that are more geared towards Guardian vs Guardian combat.- While you wont be as lost as you could be in Warframe as a fresh player, Destiny certainly has a poor job with communicating things to the player as well. I had to constantly ask questions from my more experienced friends because the game does not make it clear where to find things like where to find certain resources, fulfilling very specific quests, or knowing how certain mechanics work.- From what I gathered Mars and Venus used to be playable areas you could travel to, but to lighten the load of the game they removed both worlds. This sucks no matter how you put it as it not only removes variety in set piece from the game, you also lighten the content in your game for what I believe is weak reasoning.- A lot of the DLC is pretty over priced for what youre actually getting in my opinion. The reviews for the DLC available also arent all that positive, and with mostly good reason. I recommend buying stuff during a really good sale if youre going to fully commit to the game.Overall, Id say the game is a solid 8/10 even without all the fancy DLC to chew through.

I dont think I have been so emotionally invested in a game as Destiny 2. When I heard \"Eyes up Guardian.\" for the first time, I couldnt describe how I felt in that moment. It was...new to me. I started out as a Hunter (like everyone else), played through all the campaigns (before Beyond Light), and got with my buddy and his friends to do Leviathan (my first ever raid).

This game has helped me get through so much mess in the last 2 years. I would always log on, and whatever I was worrying about would suddenly vanish, for a while. Destiny 2 has also introduced me to my current clan that I have been a part of for a while now. We are family, and I couldnt imagine what I would do without them. One thing I have heard about Destiny is that it makes you grow closer with your friends and the friends you make along the way.     Destiny 2 is not a perfect game by any means. Not by a long shot. Bugs everywhere. Honeydew here, a Beaver there. Cheaters in Trails (havent come across one yet, thankfully). Sunsetting. Stasis in PVP (not as bad as it was). Bad apples in the community.

Ive also been a player since day 1, September 9, 2014 of the original game, and some of what Im about to talk about may be considered old news, but its still relevant to this day. So Id like to think I have a pretty good idea of what Im talking about here in this review. And before writing this, Ive constructively criticized and questioned bungies motives and decisions they have taken with this franchise in their weekly news threads bragging about the game. They responded by simply deleting threads and comments in question educating people not to fall into the stupidity pit bungie had created, and a review is where I can express my thoughts without one of bungies mods being able to hide it from the public. I truly feel betrayed by a company I once adored.So, take that for what you will.WELL THAT DIDNT TAKE LONGBecause like other diarrhea infested games made by some greedy  f%!knuggets [cdn.discordapp.com], they try to force you to accept some  terms of service  that probably says some deceptive garbage along the lines of: \"You dont actually own this product because f%!k you. Sincerely bungie ;)\" What the hell even is a user agreement; whether I bought the game or someone bought it for me,  Its mine.  I do not agree to $&cking you off, bungie.BEYOND LIGHTIve not played Beyond Light past the opening mission in Europa; the reviews for this \"expansion\" speak for themselves.And I dont even have time to explain why I dont have time to explain how pointless and dumb The Stranger is. She does next to nothing in the first game, then disappears after the main campaign, only to suddenly return in Beyond Light. What was bungie trying to do with this? There are several thought provoking  mysterious figures [cdn.discordapp.com] weve seen in video games. Destinys stranger feels like a desperate attempt to insert some very interesting character into the gameFREE TO PLAY?This is an excuse I hear all the time: \"Destiny 2 is free 2 play so therefore, the problems gone.\" First of all, Destiny was not originally \"free to play\". Second of all, of course free to play games are free to download, and free to play, however if you want to make any sort of progress in said game, or be on a comparable level to other players in said game, you need to spend real world money in the fantasy world game to have any sense of enjoyment or satisfaction. And I wasnt around for this, but hearing the whole uproar about stasis in crucible? Despite the obvious question that was asked well before the arrival of Stasis, \u201chow exactly is freezing going to work in PvP?\u201d it arrived without a good answer and has been a nightmare across all modes, with players feeling like they\u2019re at a distinct disadvantage if they\u2019re not using the subclass. And given that you need to pay $70.00 USD for Beyond Light to get Stasis, that has raised accusations of free-to-play Crucible now being \u201cpay to win.\u201dREMOVED CONTENT THAT PEOPLE HAD ALREADY PAID FORDefinition of expansion: a thing formed by the enlargement, broadening, or development of something.\"the book is an expansion of a lecture given last year\"Following the release of \"Beyond Light\", Destiny 2 has evidently become far smaller of a game than it ever was before.

Okay? Some bungie super fans have made excuses for the massive content removal. Like this one: \"if they bring the planets back the game will double in size meaning they cant add more content going forward because then the game would be to bloated to manage\"What kind justification is that? Were in 2021. You dont take away content people already paid for; this is not a subscription bungie charges for destiny, it is a product they sold. The transaction is complete. You know, other and older games like warframe gets content updates which includes new locations, and the game only got bigger. Destiny 2 got smaller. Hell, all the locations that ever existed in D2 in their entirety cant even be bigger than the world of the original Red Dead Redemption, all the way back in 2010.JUSTIFICATION POSSIBLE?This section is just to describe my cluelessness as to why a fair amount of people attempt to shield bungie and their decisions, and I feel compelled to understand why. A lot of folks arguments against me dont seem to prove a point. Many players in the Destiny community seem to pass themselves off as experts in game development and marketing, but cant make any reasonable claim other than: \"they need to make money\", \"they are trying their best\", \"all you people do is complain\".I remain confused. Why would you keep giving chances to a company that has continually demonstrated their disrespect toward you? Remember that time bungie  lied about how much xp you were gaining? [www.extremetech.com]What about Trials of Osiris running rampant with  cheaters? - which by the way, why would you make such an insanely super competitive mode for a game with unbalanced and broken pvp? I will never know. ( And no, I do not suck at pvp )Giving bungie feedback is ultimately pointless, as it is constantly ignored. Bungie is so out of touch with their own community to the point of it being comical.CONCLUSIONIm running out of space here, so I better wrap this up, though I have much more to talk about.In the end, Destiny 2 is a duplicitous RPG with small bits of MMO elements mixed in, desperately trying to maintain its declining player base. With that, D2 gets a 3/10. Our only hope of Destiny really getting any better is if bungie goes bankrupt and a better company acquires the rights of this franchise.Thanks for reading my review!

Every season you grind the season pass to get all the rewards from it. Every season you grind for god rolls on the new guns only for them to be sunset a year later and no longer be useful. They may even be reintroduced in a later season only to have to grind for a god roll on the same gun again. Every season you grind for armor with high stats only for the armor to be sunset as well and there is absolutely no need for armor to be sunset when sunsetting was only brought about to eliminate a few outlier weapons and any new outliers that may pop up in the future.Ive already paid for up to season 15 and Ill continue to play what Ive payed for but if theyre arent any major changes to the game by the next expansion to make me feel like my time spent playing Destiny is actually worthwhile, Im done. Destiny has taken too much of my time that I could have spent on other things only for me to keep coming back purely due to the fear of missing out.EDIT: With the recent announcement of Sunsetting going away, that has alleviated a lot of the problems I had. I am however going to remain cautiously optimistic about the game going forward. I may still retire from Destiny just due to my overall fatigue of the game but we shall wait and see.", "Author": "Matthachu", "Hours": 907.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 8, 2020", "Review": "yes", "Author": "NerfZedpl0x", "Hours": 211.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 13, 2019", "Review": "Shooty-shoot bang bang pow~!", "Author": "Cerandipity", "Hours": 141.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 26", "Review": "Its a great game with fun gameplay and beautiful visuals.

Destiny 2 features a wide variety of options and play styles to comfort you, the player; whether youre an aggressive fast-paced player vs. player gamer to relaxed team based player vs. environment gamer, Destiny 2 has something to offer you. Destiny 2 itself without DLCs as of 01/02/21 gives you access to only first year content for the majority of itself, however, the content provided is enough to generate an idea of what the game is and has to come in future years. Based off of its predecessor, Destiny 1, it follows the same mechanics but more fluent and provides a clean and polished feel in the player vs. environment field and the player vs. player field. The first year of Destiny 2 content provided allows you to try; player vs. player content, and player vs. environment content. These activities ranging from the crucible, to the strikes, and to gambit. Destiny 2 itself is optimized exceptionally well and is able to perform well on mid-range computers, and possibly low-range depending on build.Per Bungie, this game does have a roadmap for whats next in the Destiny series to come after the year of \"Beyond Light.\" Over the term of each annual expansion a seasons pass will be optional to purchase, allowing the player to new seasonal content, content ranging from new player vs. environment activities, to new player vs. player activities.Destiny 2 unfortunately does require the last 3 expansions to have up-to-date access to all activities, these expansions being; \"Forsaken\" (2018), \"Shadowkeep\" (2019), and \"Beyond Light\" (2020). \"Forsaken,\" following a story about Fallen antagonist escaping a location named the Prison of Elders. \"Shadowkeep,\" following a story about the Hive retaking the moon and bringing back alternated versions of previous bosses. And \"Beyond Light,\" which follows a Fallen antagonist, Eramis, discovering a power called \"Stasis\" to use and take over Europa.Overall, Destiny 2 has a variety for all players ranging from the player vs. player field, to the player vs. environment field. Try out the free version, it has lots to offer and show off. Ranging from the crucible, to the strikes, and to gambit.

The story is interesting (albeit confusing), the world is cool, and you actually feel like youre a part of this whole system going on. Even the PvP is fun, and I usually hate PvP.The problem is that the game is an absolute mess. There is zero instruction on how anything works, what youre supposed to do, how the story fits together, how you use abilities, how to upgrade guns, etc. Its an extremely complicated game, and the devs didnt even put any effort whatsoever to help new players get used to it all.For example, the story is actually really cool (in my opinion, I know others think its lame). When you start the game, you are just thrown into the middle of it. Then you try to start a mission (took me more than half an hour just to figure out how to get to a place where Im holding a gun again... not even joking...), in your mission youre all of a sudden in the middle of a story. No beginning or intro, no explanation, nothing. So for example, I go to play a strike. Its like Im at the end of a chapter of the story and fighting the boss, and I have no idea who this boss is! The whole story is completely randomly pieced together, with no coherence, no direction, and no way to put it all together. Basically everything in the game is unlocked at the very moment you open the game, so youre just playing random bits of random stories.The whole concept behind weapon upgrades still doesnt make sense to me, and Ive been playing 30 hours. Theres no explanation for anything really.Connection issues are also pretty annoying. The whole game will just randomly force you out of everything, and bop you back to the title page for no reason. Thats pretty bad. Also, the devs have planned maintenance times (which is a good thing!) but theres absolutely no warning for it... I was in the middle of a game for about 30 min, then BAM just forced out. I try to continue playing, and cant get online. I go on Google and see lots of other people complaining about an outage. Finally I check their Twitter and see them saying theres a scheduled time of maintenance. How about you tell people IN GAME? Do we honestly expect every person playing the game to be following their Twitter feed religiously?All in all, Im really enjoying the game, but the whole process just leaves me screaming in frustration at all the stupid things the devs have done to this game.

I got several friends to try out the game and they all gave me the same question: \"What do I do next?\", I feel like the game should have a better guiding/tutorial system to assist new players, Im sure if that was the case, the game would be even more popular now! Speaking of new players, the game recently went FREE TO PLAY, so people are flooding into the game like crazy, and that also brings us to the next point.When I first tried out the game with my friends, we regularly encountered server problems, resulting in us getting kicked out of an ongoing game, which really killed the fun, imaging almost winning a PVP competitive match, and then everyone got kicked out because the server couldnt handle the load... With that being said, Bungie obviously did not expect the game to get so many players in such a short period of time, resulting in some poor souls experiencing frequent server crashes and leaving a bad taste in their mouth. Though Im not sure if they have improved the servers or not, but I have experienced less server issues lately, but that might just be luck, who knows.In conclusion, the game is fun and enjoyable if you know what youre doing. Even though it could be confusing for beginners, I strongly recommend you trying out the game (the game is huge though, so make sure you have the space on your drive), but just make sure to get a friend who has experience to guide you through to make the journey a whole lot smoother as well as improving the overall experience.", "Author": "dedstar", "Hours": 534.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: February 22", "Review": "After my first time experiencing the game during Forsaken, it was then I realized what I was going to get myself into.

The first-person shooting mechanics are very well done, and when coupled with third person \u201cultimate\u201d abilities or melee weapons, the combat is a non-stop stream of rewarding fighting that just \u201cfeels good\u201d. Surrounding this centerpiece of extremely fun gameplay, are lots of activities to do in both solo and coop. These vary from casual to extremely difficult or impossible to do without a very communicative and competent team of 6. Types of activities range from pure solo, to coop PVE, to PVPVE, and straight PVP modes.ProsFantastic graphics and visualsGreat optimizationEpic sounding soundtrack with memorable pieces of musicResponsive, smooth, and satisfying gunplay Large amount of ways to play, with skills, mods, upgrades, weapons, and ultimate abilitiesLots of coop missions, both casual and hardcore Cons Extremely confusing for new players at first Increased focus on in-game store with lots of exclusive items Game is always online, and dependent on occasional unstable servers  A few bugs or QOL fixes that really need to be addressed and still haven\u2019tThe StoryDestiny 2 actually comes with 3 main story campaigns in the free version. The first one, called \u201cThe Red War,\u201d is a great introduction to the world of Destiny and teaches important skills, while allowing the player to level up sufficiently to begin other activities. The Red War campaign is the longest and most linear of all the campaigns, and feels very epic with extraordinary music and cutscenes throughout. The following campaigns, \u201cWarmind\u201d and \u201cCurse of Osiris,\u201d are also good stories that introduce players to new planets and activities, but are a bit harder to follow in terms of story plots. Some memorable and well-developed characters are encountered in all the campaigns, but it seems The Red War had the most work put into it and is probably the best one to play out of all of them. Two follow up campaigns that are paid addons, \u201cForsaken\u201d and \u201cShadowkeep\u201d, are more excellent additions to Destiny 2 that include a lot of exotic weapons and armor pieces, as well as introduce more locations, stories, and characters. Forsaken is probably the best of these two, since it has a far better story and more loot to acquire. Shadowkeep does bring some pretty great stuff to the table too but suffers from a less than average story, and confusing or grindy progression for some activities. Core GameplayGameplay is the main attraction to Destiny 2. The first-person gunplay is some of the best in recent shooters, mainly because of how the guns look and feel and also how much feedback the player receives in actual shoot-outs. Rifles have realistic recoil and spray empty shells out to the side, shotguns feel chunky and powerful, with loud blasts that obliterate close range enemies. You can choose from 3 different types of characters: Titan, who specializes in direct and heavy combat or protecting others, Warlock, who specializes in mage-like abilities and healing, and Hunter, who specializes in quick or stealthy attacks.  CombatWhile the shooting is quite fun, the mobility is also a great aspect of combat. You can double jump at any time, with some in air control too depending on the class and jump skill you\u2019re using. You can crouch, slide, and climb some things which helps a lot to traverse quickly around the world and feel badass while doing it. Most of Destiny 2\u2019s gameplay is in the first-person perspective which helps a lot with accuracy during combat, but there are a few exceptions. Using swords or melee weapons switches to third person, as it\u2019s easier to block, slash and dodge when using those types of weapons. Also, when casting your Super or ultimate ability, this switches the camera to third person. Skills, upgrades and moreThere are a ton of different options in Destiny 2 that allow you to focus on a specific kind of combat, or be a more general role. Under each character you pick, for example Titan, you can choose between 3 classes that give you different abilities. Some are more defensive, while others focus more on pure aggression.  You can choose different types of grenades, melee skills, or jumps.In addition to character modifications, you can completely customize and upgrade armor pieces, or change stats of weapons with mods. Much of the armor and weapons in the game have randomly generated stats, so sometimes you will encounter items that are less valuable than others. Even items with terrible stats can be recycled into crafting materials however. One thing worth mentioning is that Destiny is in no way pay-to-play, but it is still littered with microtransactions that keeps the best cosmetic items in a paid store.  Main ActivitiesDestiny 2 has a shared open world, meaning that there is always something going on at the locations you visit. Completing public events, random encounters or missions, or general exploring is always possible. Nearly any activity can be played with at least 2 other people, while other special modes let you play with up to 5 others depending on if it\u2019s PVE or PVP. GraphicsDestiny 2 was released in 2017, but still looks fantastic. The smooth gameplay meshes well with the wonderfully detailed and vibrant world. Each location looks very unique in its design, with each planet having a very distinct look.

Destiny provides a lot of content, there are plenty of missions/challenges to do. I recommend getting the DLC-s, they add new campaign missions, strikes and raids.- You have to grind a lot to get the best gear and mods, but if you like the game, it wont be a problem. After youll get your first exotic, youll want a full collection of them. - If you dont have friends who play this game, you can still find players to your fireteam with this app: https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/FireteamSearch?platform=4&activityType=0&lang=en&groupid . Community is nice and helpful.- NOTE FOR ACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS: it is not the easiest and fastest 100%, but not impossible to do. It takes hundreds of hours and a lot of grinding to finish it. Forsaken is required for 100%, they didnt add new achievements with Shadowkeep._______________________________________Some tips:- Bounties, bounties, bounties. Do as many as possible.- Make every event HEROIC or everyone will hate you. Higher difficulty gives better drops.- Personally I like gambit, but all of my friends complain about it. Youll definitely play it sooner or later for the challenges, so dont forget to invade and attack that primeval (I saw people who dealt 0% damage on them).- Crucible is the games pvp mode and it is good to farm some materials. There are some cheaters and afk players, hopefully Bungie will do something about this problem..- Strikes take like 10-20 minutes to finish, play nightfall for rare drops.- Raids: youll need a clan for this and voice chat._______________________________________Destiny 2 is 10/10 for me, I would sign up for the grind again.", "Author": "Nikki", "Hours": 634.7}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 25, 2019", "Review": "I love this game, but the way theyve made it so that completely new players get dumped in with endgame power levels and no idea on how to do anything is genuinely the dumbest change Ive seen in any game. Previously new players start off clean, directly with a campaign and a story-line to properly guide progression. That is, progression being not just story-line, but being a way to show players through classes and their sub-class abilities, how different weapons/stats work, how to get around the game, and more. People always said Destiny was a game to grind, and now thats just not the case. You dont need to grind, because you drop in with everything unlocked and 750 power - meaning you can hit 900 in like 20 hours or less.What is the point of this? How was this considered a good idea? A good friend keeps asking me how to do the most basic things, because nothing was explained to him. Sure, one will say he can still play the campaign, but they even made that so different that first I had to find out, and then explain to him that he has to go from orbit (have to explain all of that) and then travel to the Tower (another big explanation about what that is), then somehow guide him to a far-away NPC at one end of the tower to claim three legacy campaigns THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AUTOMATICALLY FROM THE START (like how it was done previously.)This is such a disappointment, I was looking forward to playing this game with my friends. The raids, the strikes, everything.   Getting them to understand the basics of the game will take ages, expecting them to have fun playing the co-op game-modes is a stretch at this point.Even as a returning player, this whole situation makes playing the game so grim. I remember the time when I roamed around the EDZ and encountered a Forge Saboteur, just to get one-shot while all my pathetic low power attacks just bounce off of it. Enemies like that gave you a reason to grind and become powerful, so you could return to try redeeming yourself. You could fail missions/quests/events, compelling you to go back and try to get a better power rating. Now? You make a new character, enter with endgame stats and spam one of the default guns you get. Whats the point of naming any of the bosses differently at all now? Might as well just call ARAKIS-12 a regular \"Servitor\" because it takes about the same effort anyway.   Overall, I struggle to find any good reasons to recommend this game to new players. I was really looking forward to this game coming to Steam for free, but its just been heavily disappointing. The Crucible (PVP) and Gambit is alright - I dont really have anything negative to say about them; The gameplay is great, extremely satisfying and I really do enjoy it - however I just cannot give this game a positive rating because of the new player situation. Ive been playing since the original Destiny, and it is beyond upsetting that I cannot recommend this game.   TLDR: If youre a new player, dont bother unless you have a friend to guide you AND have the patience and understanding of a saint. I really do not believe this game is worth the download for a new player anymore.

LFG is still very much a dice roll on quality.  For what its worth, Ive had this as a \"Do Not Recommend\" for almost two years, so this was enough to break that streak.The Good - With Witch Queen, we have the second-best expansion pack in Destiny history (after Forsaken).  Bungies story team, environment designers, artists, and anyone who touched the campaign (especially the Legendary difficulty campaign, which is the one I played) deserves a huge shout-out.  New location is fun, though I find myself not venturing out past the spawn point much now that Ive collected all of the hidden items.  Hoping that changes with future seasons, but well see.  Cant comment on the new raid, but I like the environment/level design of the raid area, and Ive heard good things about the raid itself.The Bad - That being said, the core playlist (AKA everything you play after youre done with the campaign; Strike, Crucible, and Gambit) hasnt been seriously reworked in years and leaves a lot to be desired.  Gambit got a weird pseudo-\"fix\" this season that seems to have made even more people upset than past Gambit modes, and I would personally prefer to see them revert to Gambit Prime, even if they drop the armor perks, as it had the best balance.  Damage gates are awful in PvE, but make sense in a PvEvP environment.  A stacked fireteam will melt the boss within seconds almost 100% of the time, but they cant do that if there are damage gates.  I am looking forward to Gambit Labs this season, maybe well get something better than Prime (hopeful, but not truly expecting it).The Same - Content arrives, content leaves.

Guessing your sales and player count started eating it, so now that bungie got its wallet hurt it decided to actually listen.-----Update-----I tried going back after sunsetting. Too little, too late. Refusing to reverse already sunset weapons just means that my entire vault (minus exotics) has been wiped out. There is frankly nothing in this game that makes your character unique beyond whats in your vault.Bungie basically wiped everyones characters when they sunset weapons, equipment was the only measurable \"progress\" you could make. Stats speaking your character is a perfect copy of everyone else, old campaigns are gone (and nothing you might have earned from them would be useful anymore anyway)However the real reason Im not going back to the game is I dont trust the devs anymore. Nothing stops them from retrying sunsetting again a year or two down the road and then reversing the decision without undoing the results. They admitted sunsetting was a mistake, but refuse to fix the problems it caused.I dont trust them to not do it again, resulting in hundreds of more hours of wasted time grinding god roles.

In my opinion, Destiny has a lot of potential to being literally the best game of all time but is managed and run ineptly. Destiny has great ambitions and makes joyous promises but always fails on execution. I highly recommend it to players considering trying out the Destiny Franchise, however I do not recommend it to players who have been with the franchise through Destiny\u2019s history. Then again, if you have been with Destiny as long as I have, you probably are still going to stick with it just out of habit. I highly recommend breaking that habit and stop blindly supporting the lacking amount of new content, partial releases, ignoring playerbase feedback, and the lack of innovation from a AAA development studio.  Overall Thoughts: Destiny is a quick habit fulfilling game if you want to get with your friends to feel like an almighty powerful being while casually and mindlessly shooting away at some aliens. Most of the game is recycled content but they try to sell it off as new by slapping a new skin on old stuff or making very minor changes. Rarely does Bungie make anything new or innovative in Destiny. The game is very rarely updated and much of the fanboy playerbase tries to defend the lack of content in  PAID DLCs  and when Bungie only provides Quality of Life changes once a season or only with new paid content, so don\u2019t get your hopes up on any changes/balances needed for PvE or PvP, as Bungie rarely provides updates with major changes. If they do at all, it will usually only be at the start of a new season/DLC. With Destiny, when you\u2019re having fun, its addictive. When you aren\u2019t having fun, it\u2019s miserable yet still addictive.  Recommendations:  I DO recommend  this game for the gun-feel, map designs, skyboxes, super-ability gameplay, worldbuilding, music/soundtrack, sound effects, and the raid experiences. I DO NOT recommend  this game for the story, missions, strikes, cinematics (a few forsaken ones were pretty good), the very limiting and uncustomizable subclasses in an RPG, ambiguous stat descriptions (instead of numbers and timers that can be easily comprehended), the PvP sandbox, competitive PvP, scarce content updates, dialog, voice acting (Nolan North, Nathon Fillion, and Lennie James are the only notably good voice actors in this environment), characters+character development, loading times, matchmaking times, latencies/server connections, The Peer to Peer PvP Network Setup (Seriously, this game needs dedicated servers.), the very small amount of changes based on community-feedback AKA \u201cBungie Please\u201d, the non-activity specific loot-pools, nor the completely unfavorable RNG loot-grind system (The only outlier being Menagerie where you can at least focus on the loot you want, you just have to put in effort and time versus most other RNG systems in the game where there are so many factors are COMPLETELY random).  To Free Users (New Light):  The campaign is really confusing and disorganized. New players will have no clue where to start or what to do, only being prompted to buy the latest dlc. You aren\u2019t clearly told what to do and what order to do them in and are allowed to skip around to do the story out of order, adding in more confusion. New players won\u2019t have much of a power grind and can easily reach the soft cap level very quickly, making you want to buy the \u201cfull experience\u201d sooner. A lot of the game isn\u2019t provided but also providing enough to make you want more/to buy the DLC\u2019s.  To New Users Buying All Existing DLC\u2019s: This game is going to be a lot of fun and a bunch of content to go through. You will likely feel very fulfilled with how much stuff there is to play and go through. If you know what order to do the campaign in, you\u2019re going to have a blast and theres a lot of enjoyment to be had. To Destiny Veterans Buying Shadowkeep/Y3 Content:  The amount of new content is  completely inadequate and uncalled for.  Yes, there will be future updates during this season providing a new dungeon and a single raid, but other than that there isn\u2019t much \u201cnew\u201d content. You can easily complete the campaign in a few hours and reach the soft-cap shortly after. As per typical Bungie tradition, we are given the same exact enemies all over again but with different skins. The enemies are basically copy-pasted with the bosses having the same immune mechanics in an attempt to slow down the players rather than making and implementing fun playable mechanics or improving the enemy AI. These lazily coded and copy-pasted enemies we\u2019ve already faced 5000 times over are not fun and not enjoyable to me. Someone who eats up effortless callbacks to stuff theyve already completed would probably like it though. We even have the same locations from the  Destiny 1 BETA,  triggering \u201cnostalgia\u201d, but it\u2019s mostly just recycled maps (albeit, they have been slightly updated) and old locations with a few new expanded areas that just scream lazy. So far there have been  2 new strikes, 1 new crucible map, and 1 very short campaign  that makes you sidetrack to do grindy bounties to artificially stretch out/lengthen playtime. The campaign even ends abruptly making you think,  \u201cIs that it? What\u2019s next?\u201d  -Similar to how the Warmind expansion ended. I doubt there\u2019s going to be any additional campaign relating to the Shadowkeep main story besides what will only be in the coming seasons (if you bought the year pass that is), which is a complete and utter joke. With this new season, Crucible has been updated this DLC and will probably ravel out of control again, be completely neglected, and become forgotten (per Bungie\u2019s habits) unless Bungie makes a dedicated Crucible Team for it. As a looter-shooter, so far I haven\u2019t seen any new sight of a new loot-pool outside of the announced Raid gear, a small handful of exotics, a selection of paid eververse store ornaments/items/cosmetics,and a few weapons you earn during the Shadowkeep campaign which is a major disappointment to any player that has been around Year 2 or earlier. The new armor system feels very restrictive, even compared to the old system, since there are different mods linked to different elemental armor classes and the stats on armor is completely RNG (as far as I can tell) with no way of getting armor you want with stats you want but allows much more flexibility for applying different mods and ornaments to customize the look of your guardian (one step forward, two steps back in my opinion). This season so far has been a complete letdown given how I am only two days in and am already bored of it and will have to go straight back to grinding the SAME OLD regular activities while waiting for the time-gated raid and dungeon releases to come out to make it \u201cfeel\u201d like Bungie is providing content-full updates, while in reality they are only doing as they always have done: Releasing an unfinished game in multiple segments, squeezing dry every last penny and playertime they possibly can, only allowing the \u201ccomplete experience\u201d to be enjoyed if you purchase it at the end of the year once everything is finally released.  History has repeated itself once again, Im hoping that more of the playerbase will catch on to Bungies typical and lazy habits.

You will quickly find there is a depth of character customization, whether practical or aesthetic, worthy of your interest and investigation. And a vast array of paths to achieve that customization. In general this game is filled with quests upon quests, menus upon submenus - goals, items and options you may not realize were available for tens of hours. Stuff to do at every turn. The game delivers a constant stream of content if you let your mouse wander. But I must re-emphasize. All of this content is just slightly different in core experience. Over time the novelty of each mode relents and you are left with the core gameplay exposed for what it is. And in my opinion that is fun. Theres nothing wrong with that. I wont pretend Destiny 2 is unique in that its gameplay loops are all navigated by the same core mechanics. When the main hub of this game is all mentally mapped out and youve landed on each world, you will find a pretty streamlined hub for booting up whichever space marine arcade level youre in the mood for looting. If there were anything negative I took away from this game its that I only felt half-interested in the story. The game itself doesnt seem worried about that. Granted, there is a lot of optional lore to this game. I respect that the gameplay itself seems to take top priority. But Im not convinced the story is anything but an obligation the developers are meeting based upon the conventions of big budget game design. To be fair, the writing itself is not poor. There may be plenty of passionate, quality writing behind the lore but its obfuscated by the games lack of interest in telling that story to the player. Overall this game is a lot of fun.

Most of the people that are still playing are either total casuals or sticking around because of addiction to certain game aspects. The PvE has been amazing in the past and has hints of being fun but as previously stated they do their best to remove all that. The PvP is a massive mess, full of hackers and people who abuse no skill options such as sword peaking. The whole game is built on old af code and software and is constantly plagued with bugs. The game has a lot of incentive issues with the activities which are made even more annoying by the fact they seem to be fixable to anyone with common sense. I would recommend not playing this game as you will get trapped in a cycle of being drip fed a small amount of content to keep you interested just enough to trap you, the game is more akin to a drug addict waiting for a fix than a person actually having fun. The only reason this game survives is because of the amazing community of people within it who will help/play content such as raids and pvp with you. There is a great sense of community and people help each other achieve great things and there is such a positive atmosphere with many challenges to go for such as low man raid challenges. However underneath this positivity there is a large undertone of disappointment with a game that is so close to perfect but never quite achieves it and always finds a way to irritate.DO NOT let this amazing community and all the awesome friends you will meet trap you within this addiction of a game.

I dont have anything fancy to say, its just all up from here. Witch Queen hype.UPDATE: 3/1/21 My opinion of the game has not changed, and if anything I only have more faith that Destiny 2 will continue to grow and thrive, especially after the State Of The Game which told us to expect new expansions all the way until 2024 (just to complete the first SAGA of Destiny), along with a host of positive changes for the game. However I will say that I cant SUPER recommend Destiny 2 right now if your sole reason for wanting to try it is the PvP. At current there is a very serious issue with hackers invading PvP lobbies and making end-game PvP activities like Trials of Osiris borderline unplayable for a vast majority of the community. While I still think this is an amazing game, and the PvE content continues to blow me away, the PvP is something to stay away from if you value your sanity, at least until Bungie finds a more effective way to stave off cheating, be it through anti-cheat or some other means. Original Review: After the depressingly disappointing launch that Destiny 2 had, Destiny fans like myself and newcomers alike were sure this game would flop. Its had its fair share of hardships, but Bungie never truly gave up on their vision for what the Destiny universe could become. That determination shone bright when Bungie made the decision to cut away from the scumbags at Activision to take Destinys future into their own hands. Having been around since the beginning, Ive gotten to watch this game grow and evolve, and become a better and better experience. Bungie has worked hard to make this game an amazing experience, and their clear dedication to the game and its community are what have turned Destiny around. I would have recommended Destiny 2 to anyone after just the release of Forsaken, and with all the changes made with Shadowkeep and New Light, I absolutely want everyone to at least give this game a try. Now that its Free to Play, theres no reason not to at least give it a shot.

If you enjoy the likes of Warframe, Borderlands etc. Youre certainly going to have a lot of fun with this title.Unfortunately beside the rock-solid gameplay, the UI and overall newcomer experience is rather horrible. This mostly boils down to newer players being completely overwhelmed by the current decision to skip the entire early-game phase which should get you used to its mechanics, core gameplay, structure and arsenal. Another massive issue is the arbitrary difficulty set by missions intended to be played at a certain \"power level\". As far as I can gather the idea is that the player always deals the same amount of damage to an enemy, however if they out-level them, the design decision by Bungie was to quarter all dealt damage which can be incredibly frustrating in coop games when your partners have progressed further than yourself. Beside the couple of hiccups here and there, theres plenty to keep the player entertained. Next to the three campaigns, that are included in the F2P version, daily missions and a PvP mode offer plenty of variety and always give you something to doUnfortunately, I dont enjoy these types of shooters, no matter how often I try.

Its not better than Halo, but Destiny 2 is a good game.GAMEPLAYLets talk about gameplay. It is your typical MMO shooter, with looter shooter element. At the beginning you can choose class for your character, such as Warlock or Armored Titan. Characters appearance can be customized later on by acquiring loot as you play the game. There is some story in this game, its somewhat interesting and you can play many modes of PvE and PvP with or against your friends and other people.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEGraphics is really good, especially back then when it was released. Its not really a top class back then, but it was good.Performance is also good, I played the game on Battle.net before and so far never experience any stutter or lags, not even glitches or bugs. Maybe Im just lucky, but the game is optimized enough to be played.CONCLUSIONOverall, this game is really good. You can sunk a lot of hours playing this game alone, and a lot more if you have friends playing with you. And you can always try the free version before buying the expansion packs.

It will make you spend hours, days, weeks, months even to get a thing you want. Itll make you go through the same boring, annoying activities over and over again to farm for an item that you want or to make minimal amounts of progress on a quest.

Bungie has always made great games, including Destiny, and Destiny 2. When Destiny 2 came out back in 2017 I immediately fell in love, only to be disappointed shortly after. I did however continue to play the game (maybe Im insane), and the game has come up since its release, with Forsaken being the best addition thus far in my opinion. Even with the game being in a generally OK state, I do have some things I would like to say about some of the things I really do not like about Destiny 2.I am not a huge fan of seasons and all the things that go along with seasons, such as the dreaded season pass, but it is nice to see regular content updates. I do think that vaulting a huge chunk of the games content that people paid for is a little scammy, but Im not gonna get into talking about scammy practices in this review. The game requires you to spend a lot of time playing in order to get things done, which is fine, I just dont feel like the rewards are worth the time spent in the activities. Strikes, while they may seem fun to new players, are very stale at this point, simply because many of them are originals from 2017, and the loot is maybe 1 legendary item, and a few rare items, and some glimmer. The only strikes worth doing are Grandmaster Strikes, but that requires you to be a certain level, and they can be very punishing.PVP is pretty bad in my opinion, and I really only play it when Im needed to for a quest or something similar. I wont go in to any detail here, its just that bad.Gambit can be fun, but the mode has not had any new maps for a very long time (in fact they removed a few maps with the Content Vault), and invasions and heavy ammo really create a snowball effect that is difficult to counter unless you have someone dedicated to counter invading.Raids are extremely fun, especially with a group of friends, but unfortunately, a lot of the raids have been removed, and only one raid currently provides you with Pinnacle Gear, making the other raids useless, unless you want a specific weapon roll, or need the exotic weapon from the raid (looking at you, Vex Mythoclast). The drop rates of the raid exotics can be pretty god awful for some players, with some people needing more that 50+ clears to get the weapon.Unfortunately, even though this is my favorite game, I cannot recommend it unless you have a LOT of free time on your hands, and also do not mind missing out on some content, and enjoy what is maybe some of the most horrible PVP I have ever played.

There is so much recycled Destiny 1 content at this point, youd be better off taking your 2-5 friends and getting Destiny 1 for Xbox or Playstation. The only redeeming qualitys of Destiny 2 are the Graphics and the Gunplay. Until Bungie figures out what they want from D2  DO NOT BUY THIS GAMES EXPANSIONS.  (All the gear from Forsaken & Shadowkeep is unusable in the Beyond Light activities) First things first:If youre a FTP (Free-to-play) player. Youre being decieved. The Cosmodrome (the starting area) is a recycled map from the 1st game, along with parts of the story here and there. If you enjoy your time on the Cosmodrome and want more content like it and youre willing to spend money. Just buy Destiny 1. Only for console but an infinitely more enjoyable experience than Destiny 2. You will never get the same feeling you get from the Cosmodrome anywhere else in Destiny 2. Beyond Light:With the addition of Beyond Light they \"Sunsetted\" most weapons and armour, meaning theyre unusable in every activity except casual Crucible (their Power Level is maxed out at 1060). Meaning all the hours dedicated players spent farming for the perfect rolled gear was a complete waste of their time. The general idea of sunsetting gear is not necessarily bad but when they release the expansion and add almost no new weapons and armour, sunsetting becomes a problem. Not only did they do this but they removed most of the games content because \"Destiny 2 is too bloated\". I bought D2 on release and \"have\" every DLC (except this half-assed one). With the addition of Beyond Light I (along with many other people) lost: 4 Locations: - Mercury- Mars- Io- Titan 4 Raids  The Menagerie  The Black Armory  Removing all this content wouldnt be such a huge problem if they actually replaced it with something. Ive seen people saying the only energy scout rifle usable in new content is a rare (so it has 2 perks not 3 (making it even more sh*t)). Not only did they straight up remove paid for content out of the game but they didnt give anything back to the people who did invest their money into this game. This type of development sets a bad precedent for the future of this game and Im disgusted that Bungie, a beloved developer who Ive grown up with would stoop to such a low level and for lack of a better term completely f*ck over their fans. SO I pose the question: Why buy Beyond Light? Why pay \u00a340 for a half arsed expansion like this when theyre just going to remove it completely in a few years? It doesnt matter how much play time anyone gets out of it, what matters is that they paid for it. Its a live-service game so yes, eventually you will never be able to play it again regardless of how much you paid. But never did I ever expect that while Im playing that content I had paid good money for would be cut so mercilessly and without any compensation. Stasis has completely ruined the Crucible experience and if youre not willing or able to shill out \u00a340 then have fun going into crucible and getting frozen in place every 5 seconds. I mean seriously, what idiot thought it was a good idea to let you freeze real players in place in a fast-paced FPS. Its Beyond me. Many exotic weapons that took the absolute piss to complete the quest to get are now purchasable from a vendor making the time the first comers spent getting them was a waste of time when they couldve just farmed strikes for the material to buy them.Beyond Light added: 6 Exotic Weapons: - Cloudstrike- Duality- Hawkmoon (Recycled from the 1st game what a surprise)- No Time to Explain (Another Recycled Gun from D1 that will set you back a crispy \u00a320)- Salvations Grip- The Lament- 6 Exotic Armor pieces (2 for each class and all new)- A new Raid (after removing 4 other ones)- 1 New strike (after removing 7 other ones)- A new campaign (after removing 3 other ones)- A new subclass for each class with added customisation (more like the skills in D1 but they left the other subclasses in the awful state theyve been in for 4 years thus making the Stasis subclass the most viable choice)Now I might have missed a few bits here and there because I refused to shill out the \u00a340 for Beyond Light. Keeping Year 4 of D2 in mind if you go look for reference of Destinypedia at what Year 4 of D1 added (Rise Of Iron https://www.destinypedia.com/Rise_of_Iron) for HALF THE PRICE it will really put it into perspective. Oh and guess what? When Rise of Iron Came out they didnt remove House of Wolves or Crotas End; though they were utterly useless to the current gamestate. You know why? Because back in 2016 when Rise of Iron released Bungie knew that asking money from you was a lot to ask and they appreciated every player who invested that money. Now? Not so much.With all that being said. Im a veteran player of Destiny. Ive played since The Destiny 1 beta and its such a shame to see Bungie, Destiny and my money get pissed down the toilet so effortlessly. I never thought Id write something like this about a company who has made my favourite games and helped me and many other people escape to another reality to fight cool aliens and sh*t. To conclude this, unfortunately I cannot in good faith ever recommend Destiny 2 to anyone until they start treating the customers like people and not like walking wallets.

This is an instance where I would give the game a neutral position if Steam allowed it, and since this is a huge title where my thumb-down will have no impact on the percentage, I dont feel obligated to \"round it up\" as a courtesy. If it looks appealing to you, by all means download it and try it.Several of my criticisms may inspire others to say things like:\"Duh, welcome to looter shooters/free-to-play/MMOs\"and that probably feels very natural to people who play a lot of those types of games. Thats not everybody, so Im laying it out for people who arent already steeped in it all the time.The \"base\" game is free to play, and the current implementation of IAP/microcurrency is about as inoffensive as it could be. However, in order to get more than a sparse few sessions of play out of the game, you need to be prepared to shell out for each annual expansion and each quarterly season (the pricing is pretty reasonable relative to the amount of content, but it does add up), and you also need to be prepared to play on the games schedule, because that content you paid for will get taken away later.I didnt play D1, since it didnt have a PC release. I started on D2 back before it came to Steam and went free-to-play. I was worried that Id have a huge disadvantage because I didnt already know the characters, but the story campaign did a great job introducing worlds, enemies, important NPCs, and new superpowers one at a time so that I could incorporate each new piece of the experience without being overwhelmed.Anyway, they deleted all that from the game, and now you get an extremely brief tutorial stage and then you can just wander around aimlessly until something grabs your attention. The entirety of the Year 1 story (including the first 2 expansions) has been removed. Four worlds (Titan, Io, Mercury, Mars) and their associated stories and activities are just absent now (there is an in-game story reason to explain it away), and as of early 2022, Year 2 (Forsaken) content will also be gone. The explanation was that continuing to add content was making the the filesize and resulting loading times too great, especially on consoles. This is understandable, and Im sure they didnt just arrive at this solution without seeing the gravity of it, but ultimately the game suffers for it. So heres the thing: in the context of whether a new player should sign up or not, Destiny 2 cannot get credit for stuff that isnt there anymore, no matter how good it was.With that said, Ive enjoyed all the PVE content that has been added since I first started playing. Each new season has substantial relevance to the story and adds a new multiplayer activity for variety. The problem is in knowing that this content is all limited-time-only. They were previously criticized for the FOMO aspect of one-season-only content, and as of the Beyond Light expansion, you can continue to play the seasonal activity (or bring a character through the story missions) from an expired season (of the current game year) if youve already paid for it.PVP is a mess, and its incredibly hostile to newcomers. In addition to the struggle of learning unfamiliar maps, the equipment implications mean that newer, underpowered players should expect to suffer for a while before the experience becomes remotely tolerable.Heres whats good about PVP:\u2022 Its accessible for free players\u2022 Lennie James performance as Lord Shaxx, the Crucible announcer\u2022 Gutting the story campaign means that new players can now begin getting stomped in PVP much more quickly than they could have previously.Here are some of the things that suck about PVP:\u2022 Matchmaking based on location/connection rather than skill/rank\u2022 Several modes dont balance players numerical levels, so players have a material advantage just for playing more\u2022 Allowing players to bring whatever rare weapons and armor they have (including exclusive rewards from raids, etc) is inherently unbalanced, and the only mode where this isnt a factor is a joke mode that comes in and out of rotation.\u2022 In Iron Banner mode, youre frequently spawned directly in front of enemy fire\u2022 Trials of Osiris, home to the most sopping-wet sweaty anuses in the game, is the testing environment Bungie uses to determine how to rebalance the perks of various weapons and armor, and those changes affect that same equipment in PVE activities.\u2022 The game gives players a variety of objectives to complete within certain types of activities, and so matchmaking may group a player who needs to win matches to fill a quota alongside a player who doesnt care about winning but just needs to land hits with a particular type of weaponAlso weirdly, numerous PVP maps from deleted worlds are still present, while several maps from extant locations are gone.You can choose to avoid PVP modes, but you wont be able to get the most out of your equipment. In addition to having certain rewards gated behind PVP modes, many of the unique Exotic-tier weapons have unique and powerful perks that can only be unlocked through completion of a quest or quest-chain, and many of these quests include quotas for defeating other players in PVP modes.Loot is a whole thing, since the game is designed with MMO sensibilities. There are numerous models within each category of weapon, and each model can drop with a variety of different perks. Armor is less varied, but numerical stats are randomized, so you find yourself chasing better duplicates. New gear gets released every season, but there hasnt been a storage capacity increase in years. I hope you like inventory management.Theres also tremendous power creep. D2 began with a numerical power cap of 300, and as of this writing it is now above 1300. If youre underpowered, enemies will shrug off damage, but being overpowered is the same as being on-par (except in the PVP modes mentioned above).My other big gripe about the game comes from high-level endgame content. Raids can be enjoyable with the right group, but the lack of built-in LFG or matchmaking (and the practically mandatory voice chat) makes them less accessible to many players, even if they meet the requirements to participate. The activities themselves are inscrutable in a way that goes against so much of the game (the very common \"theres a countdown that will kill the whole party & send you back to the last checkpoint unless you Do The Correct Thing\" mechanic makes trial and error frustrating), and if youre new to the activity, your options are to either be explicitly taught every mechanic by veteran teammates or simply be told to go watch the correct solutions via youtube videos. I get the appeal of \"solving\" a new raid, but once its no longer new, the game should offer a cursory effort to help newcomers.The game does have a microcurrency that can be bought with real money, but this currency can only be spent directly on a known cosmetic item. Personally, I find the pricing on direct-buy cosmetics to be absurdly high, but if enough people are buying them to justify the pricing (and if that income stream prevents the cost of game expansions from rising) then I dont mind, and Ill be content to just not buy any myself.Ultimately, theres no cost to try out the basic parts, so if youre curious, knock yourself out.

In order to progress or do anything in the game, you need to buy DLC. All of them. Each costing $40 on release (you can get cheaper on sales/over time).

The art direction of this game is breathtaking to behold and there is positively zero reason to not try out this game, as even if you have zero interest in first person shooters you can still enjoy the game just by looking at the landscapes. The level of awe I get from the level designs in this game is rivalled only by that of Monster Hunter World. Ive heard reviewers voice complaint that Bungie was too indulgent on how beautiful their worlds are and are not putting enough focus on making the levels good FPS levels, which is completely valid but to me thats a totally acceptable tradeoff. Destiny doesnt need DE_dust 2; Destiny takes DE_dust 2, puts it in a gorgeous skybox, adds a few teleporters and many gorgeous environmental details, and then just to be sure adds some more environmental details.You also get 3 campaigns for free. The story is pretty boring with about as many plotholes as bullet holes youll be creating, (the 2 DLC campaigns are particularly bad) but you do get to visit unique locations which means more awesome levels, which is always welcome to me.And the shooting mechanics in this game is good, I dont know if anyone is surprised by that. My only complaints are that the weapons in this game are way less crazy than those in other looter shooters such as Warframe or Borderlands, as the vast majority of special effects are just passive effects. Also the build diversity is way lower compared with Warframe or Borderlands.The monetization is cosmetic plus 2 DLCs and season pass. (technically sparrows and ghost shells are not cosmetic but their effects are minor). For the cosmetic shop the prices are a bit on the high side especially for how infrequent you get to see the effects (you cant see your armor in first person; your ship is just your loading screen; you barely use finishers; transmat effects are infrequent; etc.) but to me it just means I have no desire to buy them at all.There is paid loot box in the form of bright engrams.The performance is very good, with the exception of loading times. On an i7-4790/GTX1070ti I can get average 80fps on high settings in 1440p, with zero stutter and very few frame rate fluctuations.", "Author": "Epithet Lost", "Hours": 393.3}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 27, 2019", "Review": "I wish Steam had a middle icon for reviews because this isnt a bad game at all. Its a decent game with fun gameplay but with some flaws. For now, I will put this as a negative recommendation. To be honest, the more I played this game the worse my score gets.Review Score: 5/10(base game), 6/10(with DLC) Pros:(+) Beautiful graphics with amazing backdrops and vistas. World design is top notch, I could spend hours looking at world. The art team did fantastic work bringing this world alive and interesting. The production value is pretty darn high.(+) Sound is superb. Great voice acting for every NPC. A lot of recognizable actors within the games large cast of characters. Weapons sound incredible to shoot and the quality is solid.(+) Gameplay is still very good similar to Destiny 1. Everything feels responsive from the shooting to sliding.(+) Each class does a fairly good job being different from one another. They are all enjoyable in their own respective play-style.(+) Bungie is no longer with Activision.(+) Better build diversity compare to Destiny 1 so trying out different ways to use your Guardian can be an enjoyable experience.(+) The soundtrack is godly. The music is incredible and gives a wonderful sense of exploration, fear of the unknown, and valor.Cons:(-) Forgettable and short story(especially with New Light update). Its better than Destiny 1 but thats not hard to do. D1 and D2 share the same exact problem in its storytelling. SHOW DONT TELL.(-) Incredibly repetitive, like Dynasty/Samurai Warriors level. All you do is one thing for the entire game(shooting) with little to no real variety to spice up the gameplay.(-) Microtransactions up the alley, it may not be Killing Floor 2 bad but its up there. Thankfully its mainly cosmetics but the Eververse sells some things that should have been given within the Season Pass or Expansions. It makes the DLC feel like content was cut and then resold to make more money. (Since the release of Season of Dawn) This new update is a complete joke in terms of actual content. 90% of the newer content is not earn-able and it is behind a paywall. I dont care how much you need since parting from Activision but there are better ways to do this instead of nickel and dime your consumers.(-) NOT new player-friendly at all. I dont know whose bright idea it was to completely remove the main story and progression for newer players. It makes new players extremely confused to where to start and some quit after a few days because the game does an awful job explaining anything.(-) Reusing enemies non-stop in almost every content they release. Same enemies but with different paint jobs. They did this with D1 and its not improved here at all. The only \"new\" enemy that felt different was the Scorn from Forsaken DLC. Thats how they should add newer threat to players. Forsaken is a good example of doing it right while Shadowkeep(Nightmare bullet-sponges) is the opposite.(-) The A.I. in this game is not great. All factions have a suicidal horde mentally to them. The only faction that made sense with this was the Hive and maybe the Taken but Forsaken, Scorn, and especially Cabal shouldnt have same retarded A.I. Bosses in this game is a joke. All they did was reuse the same exact enemy template and made it larger, more HP, different name, and one or two new attack but the same awful AI which can result in some hilarious encounters.(-) Balance is all over the place. People do nothing but use cheese builds and tactics in PvP. PvE is all about using the meta weapons otherwise you suffer DPS. PvP and PvE gear and abilities are not distinctively separated(other than minor changes to numbers). Balance is in a complete hot mess and Bungie has absolutely no clue how to fix it. Even though, the community has made numerous suggestions(some actually perfect) and they refuse to listen to them. Let me warn you guys before trying this game, PvP is a cheese-fest. One of the worst PvP in FPS history while PvE is not much better. (Since Bungies separation with Activision, only time will tell if everything gets balanced out).(-) Most weapons within their types feel the same. Majority of weapons have the same exact reload, shooting, and holding animations. With the exception of some exotics and legendary gear. Borderlands was able to fix this with weapon brands being vastly different from each other. Sometimes it feels like the weapon youve gotten in 750 is the exact same as it did when you are 950.(-) Tedious quests. Some are ridiculous and some are barely noticeable. Bungie really loves trying to force people to play game modes that people dont like to do. The wording on some quests requires more clarification on what needs to be done. The lack of explanation doesnt help and tracking some quests are either bugged or worthless. (With Season of Dawn Update) This is a chore to play, thats the best way to describe this entire games content. It doesnt take any real risks to improve the game and the developers like to stay within their own safety bubble.(-) A lot of bugs(even game-breaking ones), glitches, exploits, and crashes need to be fixed. It can be incredibly frustrating to deal with.Neutrals(depends on the individuals preference):(=) Incredibly empty or silent community. Sometimes they talk and most of the time, they are silent. Barely anyone uses the in-game chat nor do they even voice chat at all unless Raids. But everybody uses Discord now for most multiplayer games, so what does that matter.(=) Lack of things to do other than shooting and grinding. Why not add fishing or hunting with Hawthrone or playing cards with Drifter or arm wrestling contest with Lord Shaxx? How about player housing or rooms to decorate and showoff trophies to friends. How about small clan halls that can be improved within the city or tower to show clans prestige? How about anything that helps build a more stronger and diverse community?(=) No way to turn off matchmaking for majority of PvE activities. If a friend disconnects or crashes then tough luck, that party gets immediately replaced. This forces that single teammate to wait or the whole team to start over. This also discourages people to tackle activities solo. Its not the games biggest issue but it is an annoying issue. Raids and high-level activities I can understand why there is no matchmaking. Also, you cant bring a 6-man fireteam to patrols unless you do an unnecessary work-around.(=) Only able to equip one exotic weapon and armor piece which is pretty lame. I understand its for balance purpose but it does limit fashion and build diversity you can work with. Also some exotics allow shaders while others do not, it is a baffling game design choice. This game desperately needs a proper wardrobe system.(=) Overpriced DLCs, the amount of content within each \"expansions\" is up to debate on your monetary value. For me, I found Forsaken well worth it while Shadowkeep was disappointing.Final Thoughts: Its an okay game, it gets some things right while getting others wrong. It needs a lot of improvements on many of its department.  At least with their separation with Activision Blizzard, I do have some hope for this franchise. The reason why I explained the Cons and Neutrals far more than the Pros was because I needed to explain why this game has these flaws. The Pros are what most people already expected out of this game. They did the shooter aspects very well but the MMO aspect is severely lacking.

Destiny 2 = Daily disappointmentsProbably, Destiny 2 is one of the most refined sci-fi FPS MMOs out there. While its new DLC Shadowkeep was a sign of Bungies lack of creativity, with the DLCs lack of new content, use of recycled assets and mechanics, Destiny 2 F2P itself offers hundereds of hours of joy to average FPS players. As you get into the world of the game you will be able to find some fun regardless of your in game focus. PvE, PvP, story based content will keep you happy for a good time. Once things start getting repetetive you might think about getting the Forsaken DLC which was a lot richer in content and story compared to Shadowkeep or just move on to another game. For PvP players; even though Bungie wants to figure out a way to introduce Destiny 2 as a e-sports game in the future, bad news for you there. Lack of balance, over powered weapons and armor pieces, games aim assitance system and such makes it impossible to take the game seriously in e-sports market as your personal skill falls behind the skills of the equipment you can easily acquire.On the other hand, instead of creating new content and fixing issues, Bungie keeps creating new problems. Silent nerfs, lack of new content, boosting of already broken items, each new season being a unnecessary grind fest  etc. While you wouldnt expect much more than a grind in a looter shooter type game, Bungie is forcing you to do the exact same grind you already did for exact same type of equipment you already had but got nerfed for no reason silently. Pushing the power level cap up while not introducing any content that would require such power levels.For the basic FPS player this game is  heavenly, with aim assist system or weapons that find the target all by itsel and requires 0 skill. But if you are looking for a personal skill based FPS experience or equal grounds in a competitive environment just skip Destiny 2 and keep looking for it else where.

Content went downhill. The season pass held no valuable content. Season of the Worthy was a massive disappointment and now with Season of the Arrivals we are yet again being met with a few breadcrumbs of nice content while the majority is straight up rubbish.This fall, 80% of all content will be marked as obsolete. Your weapons and gear will become useless. Dont let anyone tell you differently, because they are straight up lying to your face.

No they wont. Because we already received a taste of that with the new season! 75% of the new gear is recycled! All they did was change the symbol!

If you like loot and shooting aliens in the face with friends then this is the game for you! Since this is the first time Destiny is going free to play I suggest giving it a go even if you played before and given up on the game. Over the last year Bungie has been making fundamentally sweeping changes to every element of this game from PvP to the weapons system. No longer the days of double primary, but instead if you want to run three shotguns you run three shotguns. Live the power fantasy youve always dreamed of! With the upcoming release of Shadowkeep Bungie is once again making another step in the right direction towards their vision of an FPS Action MMO RPG with Armor 2.0. With Armor 2.0 youll no longer need to worry about what mod to put on your armor. Once you unlock a mod its unlocked for good! (Think CoD pick 10 system, but with their own twist). Also with Armor 2.0 youll be able to transmogrify all Eververse sets onto any new 2.0 armor sets. You can finally live the fashion show youve always wanted to! I really cant say much more, but this is the best Destiny has ever been in the games history and its only going to get better with Shadowkeep. You can now pick up Destiny 2 with all DLC pre Forsaken for F R E E which is an obscene amount of content without paying a dime. I hope to see you out there Guardians :D *Edit*Shadowkeep only enhances your Destiny experience with new and improved changed to all aspects of the game. The campaign explores what Eris has been doing since we last saw her and introduces the Darkness Pyramids into the actual game universe. A must have for any Destiny fan.*Edit 2*With the announcement of Beyond Light, The Witch Queen & Lightfall you can be sure Bungie/Destiny 2 plans to stay around for many years to come. These three dlcs will no doubt only enhance your experience further. As each of these new dlcs come out more old content will become Free to Play to all New Light Players.*Edit 3*Beyond Light just adds to everything stated above. Must buy! Seasons of the Chosen, Splicer and Lost have the most story heavy content Destiny has seen with the seasonal model. Theyve finally started to adapt the lore that you could only see in the Grimoire into the game.*Edit 4*With the announcement of The Final Shape DLC, Bungie plans to stick around for the long haul. Theyve finally got the engine to the point where they can push updates and balance patches faster than ever before. They are treating each of the original D2 subclass types, so they work like Stasis build options. The first up in Witch Queen will be Void 3.0, this is basically akin to how Subclass trees worked in Destiny 1. Each following DLC will introduce Solar 3.0 and Arc 3.0 (undetermined order). No game is perfect and Destiny certainly is not, but Bungie is always taking in feedback from the community and is one of the most open Dev teams youll ever see. This the best Destiny has ever been and its only getting better from here!

A lot of the best content is being removed to \"make space\" for new content, which seems counter intuitive. More than that, Bungie is removing beloved story content instead of stale old content *cough cough* Nessus.Lets talk about the loot. The loot is very subpar. Many of the best guns are ultimately useless, because in this game its the guns perks that matter, not the gun itself. You cant upgrade or tinker with many guns and half of them have been capped so that you cant use them in endgame anymore. Armour is a lot better now thanks to transmog, but costs a premium currency which I will touch on later.The gunplay is EXCELLENT and second to absolutely none, which would be a redeeming quality if there was actual content to use the guns in. The gameplay loop consists of doing the same strikes and raids, over and over and over ad nauseum. Destiny would benefit hugely from an actual open world with content that actually mattered, and not these half baked small little areas with public events that get you no loot whatsoever.Speaking of loot, lets circle back to the gear and rewards. You will grind out these boring repetitive missions (which I will admit, are very well made and take a while to get boring) and get blue gear. This is the worst gear in the game. And you will get it A LOT. I hope you enjoy holding F to dismantle. Sometimes youll get purple gear. This is good. Except for when it has bad stats or a terrible perk... which is 99% of the time since Bungie wants you to grind for the elusive \"god roll\" with perfect stats. Hold F to dismantle. Rarely, but still entirely too often, you will get yellow gear, or exotics. These are the best gear in the game and have some crazy extra abilities like chain lightning or tracking rockets. However, these are largely useless to veteran players as it is entirely too easy to collect all of them. Moreso, a lot of exotics are just... plain useless... Theres a handgun that deals bonus damage every five shots in a meta where most enemies die in two shots, and theres just better things to kill bosses. And lastly, a huge amount of these exotics are locked behind a paywall.Which brings me to my final point. It is so expensive to get this game. Sure, you can play it without buying anything, but if you want the freshest content and gear, and dont want to be limited to an extremely small repertoire of strikes and exotics, youre looking at about $100 every year for the latest expansion and all the season passes. You can save about $20 if you preorder the deluxe edition which comes with a full year of season passes, but its still getting to WoW levels of pay to play. And for an expansion thats gonna be around for 3 years and then removed for the next freshest thing, its even more of a scam. Bungie is still preying on peoples fear of missing out, but instead of making things timegated, theyre now all paywall.I miss this game so much.

You enjoy deep lore with plenty of story to chase up in your spare time and you like clicking heads.This game is 100% worth investing some time into. I used to play on console originally (My PC hardware wasnt up to par at the time) and I played the first title rather late to the party but, I have loved this franchise. I do however have some early game advice to give to anyone starting out and looking to get levelled up quickly.- Do public events: These give you a chance of some good drops especially if you convert the event to a heroic. Makes it a little more challenging but the rewards are boosted.- Farm for materials: Every zone you explore has its own unique materials. Gather as much as you can as these can help you get the required parts to upgrade your light level for everything you have.- Strikes, Crucible, Raids: Strikes are a good \"Smaller\" version of raids where you essentially complete a story mission and have a chance of getting legendary vanguard weapons also good for shard farming, Crucible gives you a chance to PVP and just by completing matches, you get a chance of an engram. Raids also reap good rewards too, so if you have a chance of at least 5 other people helping you out and you like team work. Thatll be a good pay out too.But of course, with every good thing comes a bad thing, a few things to be aware of too- Crucible has so much cheese: Youll quickly learn that your \"Favourite\" weapon means jack against some of the cheese weapons. The meta for matches is always changing and it can lead to a lot of salty moments.- Farming for exotics solo can be tricky: Some exotics (Unique weapons) have a difficult mission to complete solo meaning that unless you have some active friends willing to play, youll be stuck for a while.- Farming for materials: Sometimes you need a LOT of materials from different places and it can be tricky for some, so be prepared to have long moments of boredum as you farm the same areas over and over again.- DLC needed for some parts: If youre into completing collections, prepare to pay for a full title (\u00a350 as of writing) to really get further parts of the game.So, do I recommend you try this game? Yes, I really do because you get to enjoy some wonderful gameplay, gorgeous graphics at butter smooth fps and a community driven title that really changes up the normal team work based games out there.

Its free!But its also 80GB!-----A lot of folks like to compare Desting and Warframe. They are similar and thats pretty much it. The feel and style are totally different and the vision for each game is almost completely at oods. About the only thing in common that both are in competition for, is your time (and money ^_^).Destiny is also a looter-shooter but it is a MMORPG first. You get your classes with skilltrees and XP points to level up plus lots and lots of gear to collect, upgrade and customise. Plus the very linear quest-lines, sporadic sidequests and periodic public events. Also endgame raids and other instanced content. All the usual PvE MMORPG stuff youve come to expect from typical MMORPGs but greatly simplified or cut-down, then mixed with a huge dose of looting-n-shooting. This unfortunately inclues the PvP, which is only instanced. And includes the usual cons about MMORPG PvP. At least it has no pay-2-win (GRIND-2-win though...) and is a good break from the otherwise very linear PvE. No procedurally generated content here.\"Clans\" only have a 100 member limit (hopefully this will change) but folks get around that by having subclans/etc. Currently LFG is handled by a smartphone app... yes, really. Not all content has in-game matchmaking.Networking is also like Warframes... peer to server to peer, i.e. Bungie handles matchmaking but instanced content is player hosted (including PvP) but you will really seldom notice this. A lot of players dont even know that another is hosting the map. Very good netcode, overall. Pity about the server / regional server issues but YMMV depending on where you are. At launch, you cant select a different regional server which was a godsend for aussies and other maligned minorities.The grind for gear was truly terrible (grindey) prior to Shadowkeep but things are becoming more like Warframe ^_^. Just simplified.Combat mechanics... its really just shooting with guns. And its good. Its not ARMA or similar yet somehow just that bit better than Warframe. The big thing here is that its really, mainly guns. Small ones, medium ones and great big ones. Also some launchers... and swords and some bows. Thats it. Variety is not spicing things here. Even the exotics arent that different. A few of the perks or traits that certain weapons have are faily significant but otherwise, it is the same thing most of the time. Melee is almost just an afterthought. Basically just like Warframes quick strike but currently Warframes Melee 1.X is an unmitigated open toilet. Destinys melee is very simple (no combos) but it works and fits in well in this gun-centric game (its a looter-shoooter, not a looter-shooter-hitter ^_^)Quests can be interesting but occasionally some of them have pretty long laundry lists. Quite a few REQUIRE PvP participation but you dont lose much should you decide to skip all PvP altogether. Like before, the reward weapons are not that unique.Progression is essentially repeating content to obtain incrementally superior gear via RNG drops or craftable materials. Prior to Shadowkeep, the RNG required for the god rolls was... epic. Repeating multiple activities just for the chance to roll the die... but thats changing a bit. Instead of waiting for the perfect stats to drop, youre going to be able to just buy / grind for stats, then add it in to your existing gear (sound familiar? ^_^).No woofs, nor meows except that overly talkative Ordis Sentinel. At least he cant be killed (nor shut-up).Graphics look a tad dated but the art is as good as ever. Music in D2 is just a tad... less good than in D1 but still great.Is this a time-sink? Oh yes. It can be. Remember that I mentioned it was a MMORPG first? The whole thing is designed to suck you in and getting you to spend as much time as possible in the game. Doing dailies here can take all day. Sorties in Warframe might take 30 minutes. Doing each NPCs bounties might take 3 hours.

What is Destiny 2? Destiny 2 is a first-person shooter mixed with RPG mixed with a big multiplayer initiative. There are many things you can do, especially in the free-to-play version, however I recommend buying the recent expansion for the best experience (I havent played it all yet, but it looks very, very promising.)All of the things you can do:- Participate in public events on various planets (including DLC only ones)- Take part in strikes or nightfalls, where you must fight through enemies in different planets to assassinate an enemy species target.- Level up your character and increase your light level, letting you fight bigger, tougher enemies.- Participate in raids. These are 6 player, teamwork focused missions that require you to put your wits, intelligence, and attention span to the test in both figuring out, and finishing the encounters you will endure.- Much more, play the game for yourself.Destiny 2 has some extremely polished FPS gameplay as well. The gun play feels smooth and very polished, as well as the gun designs themselves. The sound design is among some of the best Ive heard in any games, and this applies for the truly legendary soundtrack as well. Seriously, the soundtrack in this game is amazing, listen to it. Graphical design is also very nice. Every planet has its own palette, giving every single one a distinct look, and an amazing one at that.The RNG in this game can be either forgiving, or very annoying. For example, when running a raid such as the Last Wish raid (Forsaken DLC Raid), there is a very slim chance you will get a very special gun, the One Thousand Voices. For me, I got it on my 2nd run, my friend his first, but for another friend and many others they got it on their 20th+ try. RNG is heavy in this game, be prepared to possibly be either disappointed or very amused by it.This game has both PVP, PVE, and PVE + PVP gamemodes. For your PVP needs, try your hand in the Crucible fighting other guardians in battle for Valor or Glory. Valor is the non-competitive progression experience, while Glory is the competitive progression experience. If youre feeling like some PVE + PVP, you can turn your head to Gambit (I believe this is still Forsaken only? Not sure.) Here, youll need to deposit motes you get from killing enemies into the bank, where your intention is to summon a Primevil and kill it to win. Theres a twist though, at any time you or your teammates can invade the opposite teams side, where your sole intention is to kill as many of the enemy players as you can. They can also do this to your side, and they have very similar intentions. If you dont like PVP when playing Gambit, you can invade and try stealing some of their motes, just make sure you get back safely.For now, thats all I have to say. Hopefully thats the gist of everything. If there is something I need to fix/something I want to add, Ill edit this review. Thanks for reading, and give Destiny 2 a try.

Whilst not all suggestions or things that people want are the same or feasibly doable, there are typically many which are agreed upon which arent game-changing or cause genre shifts or breaks of the game. However, even though thats the case, Bungie sits and listens to the whiny minority of their playerbase, akin to that of the company they were so keen to leave just recently known as \"Activision Blizzard\".

I dont honestly know of any game which has ever done this before, but in Bungies most recent bid to try to regain a playerbase theyve decided to REMOVE a large portion of the original game and various DLC packs which THEY SOLD to players for a certain amount of money. Now, I dont know about you, but I didnt purchase content for this game only for it to be deleted and inaccessible whenever Id purchased it. Planned obsolescence is not a good business model for a video game.- Every independent content release so far has heavily been a massive content rip from Destiny 1 or previous D2 content. Ive yet to play the current content, as after Shadowkeep I was hesitant to purchase anything for this game as Shadowkeep was almost 80% of the same content from D1 (Great if you never played it). Upon watching various full-playthroughs and so on of the new content, its just heavily repackaged assets and reskins of past content.- Planned obsolescence of content & gear exclusivity. Im not sure where Bungie got the idea to release seasons which have exclusive items which you can *only* get then, but it feels purely like a Mobile Gacha Game move, and mobile gacha games handle it better than Bungie has been. - A lack of PvE and PvP stat splitting. Theres been a large issue with Destiny 2s PvP for years, and its solely due to the fact that Bungie seemingly REFUSES to address the issue by splitting PvP and PvE stat scaling into two separate categories. I feel there is no better example of this than what theyd called \"The Season of Wolves\", where Bungie messed up the PvE stat scaling of Lord of Wolves and memed about it for almost two seasons rather than fixing it.- A lack of balance, both with PvP and PvE. Theres too many \"Sword of Aeons\" type weapons in Destiny 2, in that when youve received the one weapon you really wanted you no longer have any incentive to continue playing the game if youre here for the grind. Many weapons are end-all be-alls within PvP and PvE, to the point that theres not much of a competitive choice to be had regarding weaponry in any capacity.- A continual lack of consideration of player feedback, and a lack of information provided to players pertaining to upcoming content, changes, nerfs, and so on. Bungie as a whole is incredibly flippant with their community outreach, continually disregarding any player feedback regarding content, such as how they continually tried to cram Gambit down peoples throats when there was a clear lack of interest in a sort of Elementary school student act of sticking it in your face saying \"LOOK GUYS THIS IS REALLY COOL\". Bungie seems to take their own consideration before anyone within the community, and honestly I dont even really know how much they actually play their own game to have any genuine idea as to how bad things are at times. The Good:- An interesting storyline. D2 has a pretty interesting overarching storyline which spans across multiple systems, planets, and various other interesting places within the universe, but Im not even sure if youre able to access all of it anymore as theyve forcefully deleted it.- Interesting abilities. Destiny 2 has interesting abilities for each individual subclass, resulting in a somewhat varied playstyle if you base how you build yourself in a somewhat different manner than others. Various weapons synergize well with certain builds, and its fun to mix and match.- Armor customization. With Destiny 2 no longer relying upon the randomly rolled perks that theyd had earlier on, the game now allows for further armor customization in a way similar to allowing you to fully customize the look or setup of your character however you would like._Overall Rating: 5/10Worth $40+? (If you buy the content that isnt free). Im going to blatantly say no, as whos to say when theyll make it so you cant run it anymore? I know thats a bit of a stretch, but realistically who thought it would even come to this in the first place?Closing Thoughts: Theres so much good to be had in this game, but its such a shame that Bungie seems to just be set upon ruining what they have with harebrained design decisions.

Base game was nice, gameplay was good, visuals and sounds were nice too, the story wasnt bad even if it wasnt really long to clear.Then came the first DLC, Curse of Osiris and Warmind, both were nice (but had to pay for those as well). Not exceptionnal content, but there was a lot of stuff to do for both of them. Next one is Forsaken, not much to say about that one, was nice but didnt enjoy it as much. After that we got seasons, like Opulence or Dark Arsenal, with even more content that took quite some time to clear. Then Shadowkeep, that was... okay ?And finally, we got... November 10th.We were warned about content \"removal\" (put into a vault, will come back... we dont know when). I bought Beyond Light a few hours before launch aaaaand... I kinda regret doing it. The update was like 50GB, so I expected some good stuff. What I got was not what I expected. 2 hours to be able to try to log into the game only to see 4 planets gone, replaced by one giant ice thing and a map who was already existing into the game.

If not. This game is not for you.The developers simply dont care for the hardcore players anymore. They only cater the game towards casual players who spend like 4 hours a week on this game. I used to love this game and played several hours a day. But after Bungie started removing speedrun techniques, skill gaps, making questionable nerfs, etc etc, I simply cant stand playing the game anymore. The most recent change they made was to the so called \"quickswap glitch\". The \"quickswap glitch\" was essentially cancelling the weapon swap animation by sprinting, thus swapping weapon faster. This was not a harmful \"glitch\" and had been in the game since launch, a few years ago. Casual players started complaining about how the \"quickswap glitch\" was broken and allowed much higher DPS than intended. And of course, since Bungie only caters to casual players nowadays, they removed the \"glitch\" from the game. They claim the \"glitch\" was simply not accessible to everyone. I have a friend who doesnt have any \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hands, and he can quickswap. Point is, Bungie is slowly killing this game for hardcore players by only catering towards the casual player base instead of trying to cater to both.\u00b4This game used to be great. A 10/10 for sure. Now id say its a 5/10 at best. Its still a pretty good looter shooter. But the developers are running the game in to the ground. Hell, they even removed the base campaign and so much more content from the game to make room for \"new content\". The \"new content\" is 50% new and 50% returning content from Destiny 1. So in conclusion. I would rate this game a 3/10 as of right now. I would recommend this game to casual players who enjoy looter shooter games. I would NOT recommend this game to ANYONE who spends more than 2 hours a day playing video games. Hopefully my opinion will change back to a 10/10 some time in the future.

DLC is recommended to have the best experience in the gameNow coming to stuff thats currently in the game. It gets better with every season and if Bungie stands by their word, its only going to get better.

Shadowkeep: You once again get access to more guns, 1 Hive dungeon, access to Xenophage (Exotic LMG), Divinity (Exotic Trace Rifle), Garden of Salvation Raid, a Campaign mission for the moon.Beyond light: ICE ICE BABY, you get access to a new stasis subclass to get your foes to chill in the heat of combat, access to a wider range of weapons, Campaign on Europa, more missions regarding your stasis abilities, a new Deep Stone Crypt Raid with the chance to drop you the new Eyes of Tomorrow Exotic Rocket Launcher and much more to come.The Witch Queen: Let me tell you right off the bat that this is one of the best campaigns since Destinys steam release! Unlike the previous campaigns Beyond Light and Shadowkeep, this one actually gives you the campaign feel to it! You have the options to play it on a normal difficulty or a slighty harder difficulty called Legend (I recommend the latter). Apart from that you get access to a whole arsenal of new weapons, cool exotics and a new 6 player activity and new dungeons and a raid.30th Anniversary Edition:This is more of a tiny DLC that gives you access to 1 new dungeon, 1 new 6 player activity and a small collection of good weapons. I however do not recommend getting this unless you got money to spare as the dungeon is pretty good in itself and fun to experience, and Juan the horse keeps you company in the 6 player activity. The Exotics you get are the Gjallarhorn and the Forerunner, the former one being great to use. So get this only when youve got money to spare.WHAT DLC DO I GET?In my honest opinion the DLCs to get are Beyond Light and Witch Queen given how much needed content is there in them. Forsaken and Shadowkeep can be bought in the Legendary edition which includes Beyond Light as well and is recommended to purchase this on a saleSeasons in Destiny 2: In general every season once again gives you access to more weapons, they give you 1-3 exotics to get or chase in the season duration as well as the story driven seasonal quests. They also give you access to exclusive seasonal activities which they introduce only for that particular season.Now if you enjoy the game on your demo you can go ahead and get all 3 in a Legendary Bundle and the Witch Queen if you wish, or your Friends will make you buy it.Whether you are a PvE fanatic or a PvP sharpshooter, this game has something for everyone so go ahead download it and see what it has to offer to you.", "Author": "Razor-42", "Hours": 4549.9}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: April 1", "Review": "This is not my review, this is the review of someone whit almost 500 hours in this game and i agree whit 100% of every word spoken by him (He is: tst) As someone whit 4.474 hours in this game at the moment, i think you can pretty much trust my words... and his.Huge swaths of this game, its story, its NPCs, its loot, its enemies, its locations - all removed.

Yes, youre \"free\" to play for like 5 minutes before youll encounter several pay walls to do literally anything.

Youd expect to be done after you purchase all that, but Its Bungie were talking about: on top of the DLCs youll have to pay for the season pass every 3 months or so to access the seasonal content. Well, after going broke youd expect that at least Its worth it and youll have a good experience in this game right? Wrong:-This game is filled with game-breaking bugs. Many of them have been there for months but Bungie doesnt care. The more I play the more bugs I come across.-No servers for the matches. Meaning that the connection is peer to peer. Yes, not only you need to pay plenty of money for this game, Bungie wont even provide you servers to grant good connection and better experience.-No anti-cheat. Well, this is kind of related to the previous point. They cant provide anti-cheat if they dont have servers for the games. The result is a game filled with cheaters.-PvP completely unbalanced. You probably wouldnt care about PvP in a looter shooter but this game forces you to play it if you want to complete several tasks. And Its probably the worst PvP scene youll ever see in your life.-Content being removed from time to time. Especially DLC related stuff. Yes, they literally removed content from DLCs. You had paid for that? Well, too bad.-Hamster-wheel design. The game is designed to make you grind basically the whole time. Every season the level cap gets higher and all the hard work youve done to get your light to the max level is gonna be all useless. Have fun re-doing everything again. This review used to have a paragraph about the sunset mechanic but they have announced Its removal. The guns and pieces of armor that have been sunset will remain so, but It wont apply to current and future gear.Its really a shame because the game has Its positive sides.

It feels....shallow. I cant get better by being better, i have to grind better gear constantly. And the grind is too much. I personally dont even mind the micros in the game. They are not well priced for my region but they are fine if you want them as cosmetics. But the gameplay becomes shallow, especially since the enemy design, encounters and boss battles are actually very fun. The steam reviews are filled with people liking this game in hundreds of hours, and then realising that the game..technically wasnt very fun by itself is a very hard pill to swallow.I agree that it initially feels fun, but the game becomes grindy, and forces you to spend time in game as much as you can while getting quite a pathetic amount of loot. Thats why i only recommend you to play to either experience new content or multiplayer content with friends. That said i dont have many friends, and even less so play it due to the reasons i mentioned above. So Its a 7/10 game imo. I suggest spending your time trying new games and not succumbing to peer pressure by friends to play this game. The rest of my review is invalid now. Thanks for reading this-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Im a new Destiny Player. Its been 2 days since i started. Look at my hours when i posted this.  Enough said. Edit 2 - Its getting contant updates, so nice.(Edit 1 - I edited this review add that the game crash can be fixed in several ways, Ill post them in the comment section below everyone.)For anyone whod like to read a bit more.Background -Im a Borderlands 2 Veteran.Was not gonna buy Borderlands 3 on Epic because i dont have friends to play over there.So,I downloaded Destiny 2 as a free alternative to it, but instead...its taken over me. I love it so much, especially the solid gunplay and the loot, although admittedly not as good as Borderlands, is probably still better than any other looter shooter out there. The enemy types are good and its as challenging as required, basically meaning that if youve got good gear, all good, if not, youre screwed.The cast tries so hard to be funny, but its not, but the whole experience makes me giggle at those actors anyway.Right now, i only have The base free to play game and its awesome. Note :-A few things I have noticed, in general, which may be out of context too -1) Is it just me or the Gunplay and Movement in Borderlands 3 fells HEAVILY \"Inspired\" by Destiny 2 ? (For more info, see the DAHL weapons in BL3 and then compare then to Destiny 2s SMGs)2) \"GUARDIAN\" RANKS ? Gearbox are you kidding me ?3) Dinklebot (Ok, thats a good one, its in Borderlands 3 fyi for anyone reading this.)The UI Is better than Borderlands 3, and the performance....its not laggy but frequent crashes are to be expected. Also, the game is always online so you need an internet connection.(Pro Tip For emergencies - Keep a smartphone with data right beside you while doing this, if the internet goes out use it to \"Teher Data\" to you PC/Laptop)Overall a Solid Game and I would Highly recommend everyone to try it. I myself was reluctant to try it as i saw the news and disregarded it as a borderlands tryna be. But its actually great. The Multiplayer...kinds sucks and it takes a HUGE AMOUNT of time to even find a match most of the time.(at least in my case)Final Notes - MUST TRY FOR HALO FANS.

I would like to emphasize that the game is actually quite decent from a gameplay perspective. the gunplay feels nice and you usually feel like you can take on the world in most occasions at least in regards to PvE content. however, the game also has a number of issues with it that make it so that I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone unless they already sunk a ton of time and money into the game already, and even then I find it difficult to recommend.the first issue is the story of the game, because while the story can be compelling at times, and the lore is actually pretty interesting in some cases as well, the way bungie structured things make it very hard to actually keep up with what is going on. with content being vaulted and entire campaign storylines being removed from the game, it makes it so a new player may honestly struggle understanding what exactly is going on, meaning the only way to actually understand the story of Destiny is to watch an 4-8 hour youtube video basically summarizing the metric \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ton of content that new players ended up missing out on, which is naturally pretty god awful story telling.the PvE content is actually not that bad, albeit quite repetitive at times, but given the state of most live service games nowadays, i wont take points off for that. the raids are pretty much the best content in the game and if you have the game its worth experiencing each raid at least once.the PvP is an absolute \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 show. If youre looking for a fun PvP game, i would advise looking elsewhere. the map design in the game honestly atrocious, and there doesnt really seem to be any sense of balance in the game. another issue with it is that there is a large amount of aim assist in the game and there are many abilities that tend to hold your hand, I wouldnt recommend playing the PvP mode simply because it messes up your aim in other games without the level of aim assist that D2 has or the bad habits that it promotes. The developers also seem to want to push people into the competitive \"trials of osiris\" mode even though that its full of the sweatiest players on planet earth. not to mention that Ive seen less cheating in NTR than I have in trials. overall, PvP is a very poor experience and Bungie really needs to stop neglecting it if they want people to enjoy itgambit is... well lets just put it this way. If you ever look up stuff about gambit in Destiny 2, youre gonna find a good number of people \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about it. Ill just leave it at that.Overall, while I will continue to play this game (again, its crack and no other game really scratches this itch, somebody help me) I dont recommend this game due to the poor new player experience and god awful experience in PvP.

At the beginning you choose one of the three playable guardian classes and play an introductory quest. The activities are divided into player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types but the PvE share dominates. Phase 1: You are thrown into a very complex mythic Sci-Fi scenario with a rich lore (prepare to be lore hijacked, it\u00b4s massive) and are overwhelmed by the possibilities. The first step should be increasing your power level by following the story line. Get better gear, better weapons and a lot of items you have absolutely no clue what to do with. Enjoy the beauty of the different planets which you can unlock and explore the further you go getting XP. Each planet has a patrol mode, so you decide what to explore and do next. For certain game modes and activities you\u2019ll join a team of 3-6 members by group search or you join a local public event, playing with those taking part or solo if you are the only one. You\u00b4ll meet a lot of god-like guardians and in the beginning you\u00b4ll feel like a temporary help squire among knights. Phase 2: You got a decent power level and some good weapons and gear. The planets you have unlocked offer you a lot of choices how to spend your time in the game. There are seasonal, weekly and daily challenges, Strikes, PvP, Arena, Gambit, Public Events, Raids etc. and you know where to find them and (mostly) what to do. You start trying to get special/seasonal weapons and exotics. Longer quest lines start and you specialize your activities on goals you want to achieve. You\u00b4ve learned where and how you\u00b4ll get the components you need to upgrade your gear and weapons and the best modes for grinding.Phase 3: You have reached a hard earned endgame power level and top gear. Now grinding has reached its max. You do no longer just want a special weapon, NO SIR! You want the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 godroll with the special perk combination on the weapon that fits your playstyle. Therefore, as a slave to the RNG god, which is if you don\u00b4t know, the supernatural deity that controls the results of the Random Number Generator, you grind as long as you get it. And I literally mean AS LONG as you get it. The whole focus is now on getting the perfect gear in any slot for any activity, of course with the perfect skin and color shader because there is a fashion statement to make. For sure you\u00b4re hunting some great exotic weapons and all of them are connected to a more or less tough quest line. You run all activities until they are flawless (and done solo - at least you\u00b4ll try), therefore you change your mods before each and every run, depending on the activity you carefully choose your weapons and sub-class and if I didn\u00b4t mention it yet, of course your class! Now you are one of those you met in the beginning, congrats!Positive and negative aspects: Destiny 2 is definitely not for casual gamers. It is grindy as hell and you have to invest a lot of time to achieve what you desire. If you\u00b4re willing to really get into the game, if you have the persistence to repeat many activities over and over again and are focused on your goals, then Destiny 2 is for you. You\u00b4ll get a great game set in a lore rich universe and apart from the group search for Raids the community is mostly helpful and relaxed. You can also get fast help from the community support on the Bungie site! For activities on a high rank and Raids you have to find a team on the Bungie site or several others on the internet, it\u00b4s almost impossible finding people on the local chats!As usual in a F2P game you obviously need to invest money for more and I recommend the two expansions Destiny 2: Forsaken and Destiny 2: Shadowkeep. Also each season (3 months) offers a season pass for extra content & items. You can starve your piggy bank buying skins and seasonal stuff, but that is up to you. The price for both expansions is what you\u00b4d pay for a AAA, so look out for sales.Where there is light there are also shadows. D2 has server problems. You occasionally/regularly are disconnected from the Destiny Servers which is more than annoying. In the best case it gets you wandering around, but it can also happen in the middle of a PvP match or a group activity where your team depends on your help.A bigger issue is the communication between the developers and the community. In the forums the dissatisfied comments of players are piling up because promised changes are not being kept and the feedback of the player base rarely taken into account. I got the impression that the relationship between developers and the player base is struck and the disappointment huge. I\u00b4m also missing a clear vision for Destiny\u00b4s future from the developers side. In addition, the ratio of \"items you can earn\" and \"items you can buy\" shifts unfavorably towards the shop and so called microtransactions become macrotransactions, in fact they are totally overprized. This has a stench of greed and is absolutely unneccessary because the numbers of new players exploded since the Steam launch and many have bought at least one DLC. All in all I still recommend Destiny 2 because it has a beautiful world, immense story potential and the gun feeling is amazing. I hope Bungie takes a more transparent and community oriented direction in the future because this game and the loyal player base deserve it.Story & Lore 10/10Graphics 8,5/10Edit: 15.05.2020 I uninstalled Destiny 2 because of decisions from the developers side that question the basic idea of a looter shooter.

Despite this and the fact I gave this game a fair shake but I really havent enjoyed it and cant recommend it unless you like MMOs and looter shooters a ton. This game seems to combine the two well enough and the gunplay is solid but it gets repetitive to anyone who enjoys more player skill than shoot the critical zone. This game has little to offer you except very repetitive gameplay unless you enjoy grinding the same missions over and over. I spent the majority of my time in the game, regardless of the activity, following a quest marker through corridors that lead into larger arenas where I end up shooting waves of enemies, shooting a boss and then opening a chest. That gameplay loop seems to be 99% of this game and it got real stale fast.The new player experience is just horrible and I can describe my 20 hours of gameplay in a few words.\"Who?\"\"What?\"\"When?\"\"How?\"\"Why?\"NPCs are talking into my head like Ive known them my entire life and like we have some kind of history together but I dont even know their name. I read absolutely every bit of text presented to me while navigating the horrible UI and still had very little idea what I should be doing let alone why I was doing it. You are just thrown into the world and in a few hours you will have information overload and not know how to sort any of this stuff out unless you are playing with someone who does. My entire time I couldnt answer the question of what I should be doing. I watched a few new player guides and they didnt give you any real guidance, text guides didnt help me either and believe me I tried. Sure I understood what things were but not any order I should be doing it, I felt myself full of anxiety wondering if I was wasting my time or not. There are so many vendors all giving you different tasks that I was unsure what I should be pursuing. As I marked off quests I found out I had at least 20 new ones all with very vague descriptions on what to do.I ended up having to use Google to explain things to me way too often. A task would ask me to collect some item or do some activity and I would have to search what that thing actually was and/or where it is. Maybe thats typical of MMOs but I dont enjoy having to look up every little thing to know how to progress. This games seems particularly bad in that front though. Nothing is explained to you well and new players are not eased into the experience well at all.Bungie was obviously too afraid of putting new players through a good guided experience explaining mechanics and gameplay one step at a time but if you dont have friends who know what the hell theyre doing you are going to be at a loss real fast.The monetization in this game is complete overkill too even for a free game. Season pass, payed expansions, cash store with fake in game currency. There are other free games that do just fine, with less players than this that have much fairer microtransactions.Someone message me when Bungie releases a new Marathon game instead.

The gunplay of the game is solid, and the story is good these days and decently told, but I feel like thats all Destiny 2 has going for it anymore.By design, Destiny 2 wants to be the only game you ever play. The time requirements to accomplish anything (Story, missions, etc) require a daily/weekly investment of a few hours to accomplish your weekly progression. Pick up a few relevant bounties, do a few missions. Note that this progression is metered, meaning that regardless of how much you play, your light level can only increase so much so fast; certain activities have light level requirements, meaning there are weeks between you being able to do things with your friends. Weeks of grinding content you may not like, because there are very few sources of light upgrades, and if youre not utilizing them, its even slower.On the other side of the coin: If you want access to more interesting builds that require a lot of specific mods, exotics, or certain stat break points, then you will have to farm *a lot* more to accomplish this goal. This will be required if you want to take advantage of whatever the current meta or meme build is for crucible, for example.Because these concepts are integral to the games core design, if you are not keeping up (Read as: grinding to the softcap for light at every opportunity) then you will find the game to be unplayable. You cannot do activities with your friends, you are an active detriment to your team in PVP, and in general you are in for a bad time.Not only that, because the game is constantly sunsetting content, you will actually be missing out on exotics, mods, and exclusive items.

Its about sunsetting. What a consumer-friendly term that is - sunsetting. Sounds kind of peaceful and idyllic, doesnt it? Ah, all that content is off to a better place.To be recycled and sold back to you again.Bungie has been repeatedly unable to match the quality of Destinys best year of content - Year 2. They have taken their fall poorly, relying on endless content recycling and porting of modes, models, and locations from Destiny 1 into Destiny 2 to keep their player base occupied with mediocre, unsatisfying events and loot chases for nearly a year now. They hope nostalgia will substitute for actual game design. As that trend continues into the foreseeable future (with no Destiny 3 in sight) were left to cope with the fact that Destiny 2 is just a platform for Bungie to remove things you have already paid for, let you sit for a few months, and then add them again in a content-thirsty season pass they expect you to buy without thinking. And people will buy it. Theyll shell out $70 for a deluxe expansion pass with no gameplay or concrete information given, $20 for season passes after Year 3 was an unmitigated disaster so horrible it drove a player with 2000+ hours to quit, and $15 for Silver to buy all their fancy sparrows and ships and emotes and ornaments for weapons that will be useless soon enough.Dont waste your time grinding this game. The plot moves at a pace that would be faster if I called it glacial, the main three game modes have been abandoned and are being removed from the game slowly to make you buy them back later, and the money you are paying for new content is essentially being torn from your wallet so Bungie can funnel it into making more Eververse items.If you want to play a fun looter-shooter, I have heard Gunfire: Reborn is good.

Just shooting the various alien races you are up against is fun. The main fun point of the game is to just grind for a type of gun that you like with favourable perks. The problem with most primary weapons is that they rarely pack a punch and so require damage perks to be really viable. This creates really obsolete setups and rolls on most guns, as most people go for a damage perk and reload perk. Instead of actually making them viable without these perks, Bungie just decide to make it so that these favourable perks are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 instead of making an incentive to chase after more unique and different perks, making using primaries overall a bad experience. Certain gun types and perks are never seen and Bungie does not give 2 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about that.Another bad aspect is the fact that Bungie does not care about any of the weapons you have grinded and fell in love with, as they will be making it so that after a certain time passes these weapons and armour pieces will be useless in endgame tier content. This, in theory, would make it so that less used guns will be able to come into play in the future and people will go out of their comfort zone to try out newer weapons. What they are doing instead is just giving us the same exact weapons so that we grind for it once again to gain a similar roll from the one we had originally, so that we can use it in endgame content again, all so we spend more time playing their game and hopefully spend more money.The worlds and music in this game is absolutely gorgeous. Michael Salvatori is single-handedly carrying the entire music of this game, and it is an absolute beauty for the ears. Dreaming City is one of the most beautiful areas Ive been to in any game.Now the problems involving playing with others: Only the most basic of activities get matchmaking, which makes you have to rely on 3rd party sources to find groups to do harder, endgame activities such as raids or nightfalls. If you dont have a close group of friends or an active clan you are out of luck.PvP experience is extremely unbalanced and just overall not fun. The game is more PvE based and PvP is literally just an afterthought by the devs, with no real changes being made to the experience. An update once every 2-5 months seems enough for Bungie. The \"Pinnacle PvP activity\" that was promised to not be half-baked was essentially raw and implemented extremely \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 mechanics that just did not work out for them, causing players to lean away from the gamemode rather than play it.Story-telling is basically non-existent. Really little is actually shown to you in-game, its just the tip of the iceberg. The lore is again something you have to dig through 3rd party sources to really find out and learn. Story points started in years ago get none to a little bit of development each coming year, with story aspects feeling entirely abandoned as Bungie decides to open new story points instead of finish already started points.No setup really feels viable, nothing makes you more unique than someone using base armour when you have endgame armour. Stats are mostly meaningless as they dont affect the game in any way whatsoever. Rarely are there unique mods that really have an impact on your gameplay. The armour pieces from raids that are able to slot some of these unique mods will also no longer be usable in endgame content.A large aspect that is never talked about is how terrible and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it is to start this game in the first place. Anyone who sees that this game is free and want to try it out almost immediately regret it as there is no directions or help given to you by Bungie. I had to make a new account myself to truly see how bad this game was to get started with in 2020, and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Everything is just shoved into your face, nothing is explained and it feels like you were just given a gun and expected to go do an endgame activity, without even knowing how the game works. Players are overwhelmed and end up dropping the game after around an hour of playtime.I have about 4000 hours sinked into the entire franchise, and over the years I can confidently say that Bungie never learns from their mistakes in the past and repeats them again and again, after which they decide to revert their mistake and say how they were always listening, around an entire year later...Overall, if you can get over the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 introduction to the game, just keep going. You might like it and make friends as time goes on, but I cant recommend it otherwise. In order to really have fun you will need to sink in at least 500 hours into the game, without a single doubt. Just try it for yourself, youll either love it or hate it.

Its still enjoyable to play, mind you, and I get back into it for a bit once every few months to a year, but with each new expansion Bungie seems to take out more of the good things, and add more bad things. The removal of Red War was absolutely stupid, though I guess they wouldnt want the F2P people to have too much content for free or whatever. Shadowkeep was definitely a decline from Forsaken, but compared to Beyond Light, even it is great.The addition of Stasis has almost completely ruined all of PvP. Arc, Void, and Solar were balanced. Stasis is not. I get they wanted especially new content for this expansion because Shadowkeep was so underwhelming, but they really screwed it up this time.Personally, I dont mind that they made it free to play, despite having paid the full price for it myself. But if making it free to play is what lead to this steady decline in quality, then I can absolutely say I vehemently disagree with the action. TL;DR - I enjoy the game still somewhat, and I will continue to play it every now and then. But Bungie really needs to get their \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 together with how theyre running it, because with the rate its going now, it will be completely unenjoyable within the next year at the most.

(not Lumina. Lumina isnt worth the time spent for a exotic quest)Trials of Osiris (hasnt been seen since D1)Reason why I call Shadowkeep expansion the Shallowkeep is that the campaign was pretty shallow and the antagonist wasnt really exciting or well done compared to others before. Ghaul, Oryx, Crota, SIVA. The faction here was just plain old hive and the final boss of the campaign doesnt end up being the raid boss of the said expansion but the seasonal content of Shadowkeep did some wonders and failures.Season of Dawn is probably my favorite as it was the first season to make it so you didnt had to grind a lot of levels and just had to do 10 levels. It reintroduced a lot of fan favorite weapons from Curse of Osiris with new fresh perk combinations for the player to play with and finally this was a season with a actual campaign that was a lot better than the actual expansion of Shallowkeep itself (you could also go back in time to save Saint 14 or future to see what lies ahead for your guardian.While all the other seasons introduced something cool the release of shallowkeep introduced game changing armor mods to make builds a lot more unique and fun. (Warminds, Charged with Light). I want to mention this but back in year 1 or year 2 you had the ability to change the energy of your weapons so yes you could have had a void energy Ikelos SMG and be set for life.Now Im going to mention Beyond light/Witch queen stuff of pros and cons.Beyond Light----------------------------Reintroduction of D1 Content Ritual WeaponsVault of glass (Season of splicer/D1 Vanilla Raid)by the release of Beyond light players were reintroduced to the Cosmodrome from D1 the epic tutorial place of Russia.with only one new strike LOL.5 new strikes (3 of them being from D1) Introduction of a new NPC who doesnt feel like he should be in destiny at all.Owning the Deluxe version of said expansions now let you keep all seasonal content so they dont go away after the season ends.12 new exotics and 2 of them are from D1. (No time to explain and Hawkmoon)a New Subclass with similar customization of D1 Subclass treesIntroduction of Stasis weapons (literally just a kinetic weapon)Only seasonal exotics I can really talk about that were unique was Dead mans, and Hawkmoon since their missions to earn and fully complete them was worth it to the player.Now Im going to mention the pros of Witch queen which I have not played the dlc but have experienced some new content of it.Witch Queen--------------------Introduction of weapon crafting so you can finally craft a specific weapon roll you want.Introduction of crafting exotic weapons.Introduction to a new weapon archetype which are Glaives. basically spears that shoot energy balls by doing damage you will gain a meter to your weapon that brings up a shield that makes you take N O  D A M A G E.13 brand new exotics 2 new strikes (yes only 2 new strikes keep that to your head)A new campaign that doesnt force the player to do side quests to progress (Just think of it as any other shooter with a campaign that lets the player progress to the next mission).Reworks of the said Light subclasses Void, Solar, Arc but void was completed first though. a brand new raid that actually did challenged people and a boss that DOESNT STOMP.Kings Fall (returning D1 raid and you might be wondering why I added it here because it basically got confirmed when Saturn was shown on the world map and Savathun herself mentions it)thats all I gotta say about the pros of these expansions but here are the cons all in total from Year 4-5----------------------------------Downsides/ConsBeyond Light Introduced DCV (Destiny Content Vault) which removed over 50-40 gigs of content.There is almost no fun raids in Destiny other than Last wish since Scourge, Crown, Spire, Leviathan got removed (sorry Eater but you are a strike and not close to a dungeon nor a raid) I know the new raid might be fun at first but overtime the more you do it you will get into lobbies were no one speaks to each other and dont really care about having fun. NO NEW DUNGEONS by this point. The bungie anniversary content will be removed in a year so goodbye to those Halo/Marathon/Myth weapons and the dungeon.Introductions of new dungeons are now paywalled behind the Deluxe Edition of any new expansions so if you bought the expansion without deluxe you basically got scammed by Bungie themselves.The \"new\" trees that the subclass reworks are getting is basically the same thing from Destiny 1 (which isnt much of a bad thing its just the fact that they just ended up reusing stuff from D1 which kind of shows bad gamedev)Removal of Pinnacle Weapons (Pinnacles are basically legendaries with exotic weapon traits that were rewarded to the most dedicated and skillful of players of Destiny).remember how there was 523 weapons now theres only 304 legendary weapons in the game.Now I havent mentioned what you can do as a person who hasnt bought the latest dlc or is free to playall you can do as a free to play now is Strikes, Gambit, Crucible (including Iron banner) and finally Vault of glass.Heres what you cant do as a Free to play playerTrials, Seasonal content, or any of the said dlcs you have to buy.this may not sound a lot but if we compared back then what you were able to do as a F2P you were able to do 3 raids, 3 Campaigns, exotic missions. some of the secret missions (Outbreak/Whisper) Menagerie, and Black Armory.I genuinely like the game for its gunplay and mechanics but for a game thats going to end up removing content in the future and selling it for 80$ I dont want to support this game as much.all I really do in this game is just play gambit or crucible. nothing exciting about it. is the game worth 40-80$? not its not You can get the Expansions a lot cheaper off resellers and you will SAVE a lot more money for buying it off a reseller than buying it officially on Steam or Bungie.

Otherwise, do not bother. Ill explain further. The gameplay is very, very fun. The game looks great too. The major issues come in terms of balancing, in some regards, but most the drawbacks are in monetization. The game is free to START. NOT free to play. The gameplay, this game lets you experience the power fantasy of being a powerful space warrior wielding The Light. At first. The content eases you in at first, then ramps up in difficulty as you get later into the game. Eventually you end up doing things so difficult you feel like giving up! But thats where your fireteam comes in. Call in friends and backup guardian, get back in there and go at it again. PVP is a bit rough, its decent and fun but there often balancing issues. But thats an expected issue that.. usually gets fixed. Eventually. However, this is marred by the possibility of things being removed and the Fear of Missing Out. Even if things arent played that much anymore, having the content available only makes the game all the more diverse in terms of OPTIONS for things to do. And in terms of the FOMO, thats most likely on purpose. Removing things with weak excuses as explanation is merely spitting in the faces of those who enjoyed the availability of it all. Sudden items players liked to get vanishing. Rotating loot pools is fine, but removing them completely? No. Players WILL eventually tire of things they enjoy suddenly vanishing.  This is especially bad with collections. Sunsetting and Vaulting has PERMANENTLY locked away completion for certain weapon sets and armor, and even lore.The visuals are wonderful, many settings are gorgeous, atmospheric, dreary, or even creepy and horrifying. Supers look wonderful, they have great weight to the animations, and the armors and shaders can be heavily customized to make your guardian look amazing. Audio is also on point. Things sound accurate to their appearance, and the design is quite immersive.Now.. Monetization. As a free player you are extremely excluded from many activities and much of the content. It really nudges you towards paying for the latest season which has a sort of battle pass attached to it, and the DLC. However, these purchases are most often a mandatory thing if you want to experience EVERYTHING the game has to offer. Whats worse, even if you buy a season, you do not have the option of retroactively unlocking your purchases if you dont complete the reward tracks. Yet further, for whatever reason, Bungie is the only company I know who actively removes payed for content. Many, many players like to argue nobody plays that content anymore so its fine they removed it. I kindly tell those players to shut up. You, as a consumer, clearly do not respect your own rights. Even if that content was made free later, others still payed for it. It is, by your rights as someone who payed $60+ for these prior expansions or $10+ for prior passes, something that should have stayed for you to play as you wished. Unlocking reward tracks retroactively is also part of this. Its not hard to implement. Data space is a poor argument as well.In fact MUCH of the diverse and unique elements for things have been removed due to the Sunsetting and Vaulting practice. Namely the ever so popular Menagerie, the Sundial, Leviathan, Titan, Io, Mars, Mercury, Seraph Bunkers, The Forges, Many Strikes, Amazing Exotic Quests (Like Whispers and Outbreaks for example), The Farm, Many popular weapons, Red War Campaign and the related Mars and Mercury ones, are all gone. Including other things. As an evolving game, there are arguments to be made for things to go away due to lore related reasons or even balance changes. Thats as far as I go with that argument though. Content that was once playable and neat activities that could have diversified things and made the game a LOT more diverse have been taken away. The worst is these are things that have been payed for, to reiterate. The content should be available for those who are new and may have wished to experience it all.In the end, its a wonderful game. But until things are either returned to the game, or they stop removing things (RIP Forsaken), it wont get better. Please, Bungie, find a way to return the many wonderful things you had in the game. Even if its obsolete, the option should be there. You have the potential, you have the skill, its just a matter of how much love for your game you have. If theres issues other than that, you CAN figure it out. But in the end I cannot recommend your game to anyone unless they intend to be INVESTED. This game, in the end, is an investment. Your time, your resources, your money. If you dont want to commit to this title, then dont bother.

To start off, Destiny 2 used to be great, but it started to go downhill (so fast in fact that youd think it actually fell off a  cliff)since the Shadowkeep expansion. It used to have amazing gunplay and it felt great to use all kinds of weapons. Now however, Bungie is essentially a mad scientist that constantly nerfs everything that the player can use. Which has led to a point where now everything feels weak to use and no longer satisfying. Whenever they do buff something, they inevitably undo that buff because now everyone was using the only good weapon. I no longer care for grinding new weapons, nothing feels good to use anymore and it feels pointless to get new weapons or grind god rolls for older weapons if theyre gonna be useless in the future.There is a lot of content in the game, but somehow, theyve managed to make it boring with how the quest system is designed. Every quest you get will be repeating the same kind of activities. Kill X enemy 50 times, do X public event 10 times, do X matches 10 times, search X place again. There are some quests that mix things up a little bit, but those are far and few in-between and still follow the do X 20 times. And then theres the very unsatisfying end-game content.Content in this game is wasted. Theres no point in doing older things, which is a good and bad thing at the same time. But whenever new content is added now, it gets removed 3 months later. Because of that, it adds pressure for me and others to complete it all ASAP. We want to do everything ASAP because we want to experience what is offered and experiment with what is available. If we dont do everything ASAP, there isnt enough time to earn what Bungie has temporarily unlocked in the final weeks and itll be removed eventually. Well never again get the chance to earn certain loot. Its not fun having that pressure. Its nothing but FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).  The end game is a joke and is a waste of time. Your weapon selection for end game PvE activities is heavily limited, you dont get a chance to use some of the only fun weapons you like. End-game PvP, Trials of Osiris is nothing but hackers, is unrewarding, constant connection issues (which is a problem with the whole game) and disconnected from a game equals a loss and temp ban. The PvP can be fun however, learning how to play using your abilities effectively and learning the weapons. Unfortunately, the competitive game modes are not fun because of what I mentioned before.End-game PvE content is a mixed bag. Raids and Dungeon are absolutely fun, I love the sense of teamwork and players helping other players learn how to do the raids and activities. I do like the idea of the endgame Nightfalls (except for how theyve handled the new Grandmaster difficulty) and the new champion enemies added. Unfortunately, the new enemies are monotonous, being practically invincible to all weapons type except what bungie want you to use for that season. Weapons I find fun to use are worthless, making the gameplay loop crap because what I find fun to use isn\u2019t allowed.Speaking of the gameplay loop of this game, all I can say is \"ogod, give me a break\". Bounties, bounty after bounty after bloody bounty. Do X amount of bounties to get a reward, do X number of kills with weapons you dont like, do X number of streaks in PvP. Its always the bloody SAME! Just over and over again. What was the definition of insanity? To get rewards that progress your character, you have to do mind-numbing activities and bounties constantly, which makes the game boring and repetitive. You do get lots of loot, and you can say thats good, but in reality, its quantity over quality. The amount of crap that you get is stupid. Almost all weapons and armour that you pick up in the world is utterly useless and waste more of your time. Youll be constantly destroying what you pick up because its worthless and doesnt progress you in any way.The good elements of this game are the world itself. The environments are great and you can always tell where you are, what planet youre on. Not much ever looks the same. The music is great, the game visually looks great and some exotic weapons may be fun. There is a lot of lore in this game that you can explore and inevitably get disappointed in because those stories will never be touch again by the devs. Character armour is a mixed bag, some things look badass and epic, while others look like an absolute joke and are vomit-inducing. But because how this game has to be played, itll all become boring, repetitive and unrewarding, which is unfortunate because there are some things that are great.TL; DRThis game is pointless, pathetic, unsatisfying and ultimately a waste of time. Since Shadowkeep, it has been rapidly going downhill with bare bone content releases that add up to nothing. New content added will be removed in 3 months, never having any real impact to the game world. Meta is constantly changing every few months, so you never get a chance to truly master a build/playstyle. Anything remotely fun to use is nerfed, any buff added to weapons are inevitably reverted. Weapons arent fun to use anymore and youre severely limited with your weapon options in regards to end-game content. The game is overly grindy because of what it requires you to do, and that gets boring. Raids and Dungeons still are fun to play though and provide a fun challenge. There are good elements of the game, but are overshadowed by its negatives.", "Author": "AussieTerrorist", "Hours": 878.7}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: December 9, 2020", "Review": "Destiny 2 is one of my most favorite games of all time.

I unfortunately cant recommend it to veterans of d1 maybe starting it with the release of beyond light. Or to all of the new lights out there. With the how the game is right now it is more focused on your power level being the highest it can be. That might not sound that bad but like 50% of the ways of getting power from d1 arent here like factions for ex. It used to be the guns/armor that held you back from the higher level of content in the game. Now its all about 1 number. Also with how destiny 2 content is done we get 1 drop of content for the week to keep us busy. For ex this week it was hawkmoon coming back to d2 i finished the whole quest in 2 hours. So there just isnt enough content after you reach endgame. Also since half of the solar system went into the dcv (destiny content vault) There is even less then ever. Now for the next subject raids. Destintys best point is the really well made raids. The raids went away for ex leviathan and all of the other parts of levi. 5 raids were vaulted with beyond light one of the most farmed piece of content in the game gone. Everyone at the endgame level and that have been with the game for years all know a sad fact. The game may die before the next dlc and this sucks.

I dont care what your player engagement data shows, I dont care what someone at Bungie thinks we should or should not be using, and I dont care if you have problems balancing or updating the game (which are, BTW, your problems alone).Some of us are attached to our weapons and armor not because they are overpowered, or because weve spent a lot of time acquiring them (which, in many cases, we did, but this is not about that), but because we like the look and/or feel of them. It makes our Guardians ours, and you taking away the stuff weve come to cherish as our own for no other reason but because it is best for you is both disrespectful and bullish at the same time.Sunsetting has made me lose interest in any gear drop in the game. Some players go on about \"any armor piece below 60+ total is insta-shard\", or some arbitrary number like that. Well, guess what? Any gear drop I already have is insta-shard for me. Why? Because three months, six months, nine months and a whole year will go by in the blink of an eye, and then all of that gear will be useless anyway (it feels like Shadowkeep was released yesterday, and its gear is already obsolete \u2013 just look at the number of posts complaining about that).I will repeat: in the blink of an eye. One year is nothing. And that is for Beyond Light / Season of the Hunt gear. Previous seasons weapons and armor will expire even sooner. And to be perfectly honest, having someone at Bungie dictate what weapons and armor we get to carry over on a season by season basis fills me with dread. You have shown time and time again that you do not have the players best interests at heart, and there is no reason for us to believe anything will change in that regard (you not making any attempt to justify armor sunsetting only solidifies my opinion about that). Plus, your obsession with making us play the game your way is obvious to anyone who has played Destiny 2 for any meaningful amount of time (and especially so to those of us that have been here since day one).Oh, and not to forget the single most infuriating thing about you, Bungie the Game Studio: every time you make a design decision that turns up to be not-so-good it takes you ages to rectify it, almost like you are purposefully testing the limits of your players patience.Your community managers keep telling us that we should give feedback in the form of how some aspects of the game make us feel, and not to tell you how to do you job.OK, so here is my feedback, if it wasnt obvious enough: sunsetting makes me not care about weapons at all, it makes me not care about armor at all, and it makes me feel like every piece of gear I use in the game I get to use not because Ive earned it, but because someone at Bungie allows me to.

It would make for a great single player game. The story is nothing special, but for an FPS, Ill say they put extra effort in.

All amazingly well done things in this game. Make no mistake, the people over at Bungie know how to make a great game. Unfortunately they do not know how to keep it great all the time. The constant changes to the game that just seem to artificially inflate playtime are ridiculous. Im getting frustrated thinking of all the awful decisions that Bungie has made with the game, so Im gonna list them all. PvP I used to main PvP all the time. Didnt really care too much for Raids for reasons that Ill get into in a later section. This preference to PvP over PvE did change over time because Bungie kinda dropped the ball with PvP.Lets start with the most glaring issue: cheating. Bungies anti-cheat is on-par with that of a lemon alarm clock.A quick search on youtube will show an abundance of videos where people get into a lobby with cheaters that absolutely wipe the floor with them. Its absolutely awful when youre playing Trials and come face to face with someone using hacks.I dont have too much to say on this one because its hackers. No one likes them, so it should be obvious how much of a problem it is.Next we have (what was the final nail in the coffin for me) the map issue.It has been 658 days (as of writing this) since a new PvP map was added. It honestly is unacceptable that Beyond Light did not come with a new map, EVEN THOUGH it was priced the same as Shadowkeep. This is ignoring the fact that two of the three maps that shadowkeep brought were reused from destiny 1. But lack of new maps is one thing.  VAULTING A TON OF OLD MAPS WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE AN ABYSMAL SELECTION OF MAPS TO PLAY ON IS ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY.  I am dumbfounded that Bungie made the decision to not only avoid new maps, but to also limit the selection even further? Its not like they took out 2-4 maps. They took out 11. We had 30 maps before Beyond Light. A third of the maps just *POOF* GONE like our money and time!Balancing weapons is also a joke, it takes forever for Bungie to fix anything or theyll just straight up turn that item off for a short time being (Warlocks know what Im talking about). Its clear Bungie doesnt playtest anything, looking at Stasis here.Honestly the whole of PvP is pathetic. Cheating is rampant, map choice is small, and if you arent prepped to deal with the meta, youll get stomped on. Its not an issue of \"Getting Gud\" its getting lucky with drops or just buying whatever newest DLC Bungie just pushed out. This is where I get to core issue I have with PvP: Bungie ignores it until they can profit off of it. Why would Bungie invest time in the free to play aspect of their game? If you want people to pay up just put the new and fun stuff behind a paywall! But as soon as a big DLC is around the corner? Bungie will suddenly decide to shake things up. In Forsaken, it was the new supers and exotics (Looking Blade Barrage + Shards and Spectral Blades+ Gwisin Vest) that made PvP virtually unplayable unless if you forked up the cash to go watch Cayde die and get a sick new super in the process. Same thing happened in Beyond Light with Stasis. Crucible was AWFUL for 2 and 1/2 seasons because Bungie couldnt have been bothered to playtest and balance their product. Again it was the situation of \"Wanna have fun in crucible? Well you gotta get our new shiny DLC to do so!\"Crucible is joke and I miss Legions Gulch. Gambit  So Bungie did REALLY good with Season of The Drifter. Like really really good. With this old season we got The Reckoning which had some of the sickest music Ive ever heard in all of Destiny. But with Reckoning we got specific armor sets that would define your role in a game of gambit. This is the single coolest idea Bungie has ever had for anything ever. It took teamwork to have everything fall into place but man was it incredible banking 20 motes and sending a behemoth over to the other side. Gambit Prime was a lot of fun while normal Gambit was meh. But with Beyond Light all that was thrown out.I just dont get why Bungie makes all this progress and actually made Gambit interesting and then reduced it to the absolute joke of a gamemode it is now. New Gambit is not fun. You either stomp or get stomped. Its a race to see who banks first and from there its usually decided.Gambit also runs into the maps issue that crucible has. There are like 3 or 4? I honestly dont even remember if they vaulted a map from Gambit because its no longer on my radar at all.Theres really only two reasons to play Gambit now: either youre a sweat who wants a Bottom Dollar or you have to do bounties. Strikes These are lame. Bring back Skeleton Keys and/ Three of Coins from Destiny 1 and maybe this will be worth peoples time.For those who dont know:Skeleton Keys would allow you to open an extra chest at the end of a strike for a chance to get strike specific loot that was sick as hell. The weapons were worth your while (Grasp of Malok anyone?) and the armor was inspired by the strike you had just completed. The feeling of power you would get from completing the Sunless Cell strike as a Titan and then getting the helmet that was the exact same helmet the boss you just slew was wearing was on another level.Three of Coins was a consumable that would up the chance of an exotic dropping until the end of an activity. This was best used in the Heroic Strikes playlist because of how easy it was to use. Now it never guaranteed a drop but it did increase your chances a good amount. In Destiny 2 exotics are given away like candy (Other than lost sector and raid exclusives). Theyve lost all meaning unless if you get a high roll on one. Xur is genuinely useless after a season or two because by then youll have all the exotics he can drop anyways. Three of Coins would make grinding for new roles better as well as bring life back to Xur.Strikes are boring and tedious. Please let us kill the boss early if theyre dumb enough to show their face earlier in the strike (Omnigul clone Im looking at you). Raids Raids are the most fun youll ever have in this God-Forsaken game. Itll be a pain in the ass to get started on them though.The biggest problem with a raid is getting 6 people together to do them. You either somehow get all of your friends on at the same time and convince them to try it or you just try your hand at LFG. However you usually need to know what your doing for the LFG to work.If you dont know how to do the raid, your LFG group may even just kick you. So you need experience to be successful in LFG but you dont know where to get the experience other than LFG. Just hope that you find a chill raid group thats willing to walk you through it. BTW LFG is where youll find some of the DUMBEST people that play this game I swear. This experience issue wouldnt be an issue if there was an easy way for people to find someone willing to teach them. Maybe , I dont know, a SHERPA? Most people playing this game wont know how to find a good sherpa on the reddit forum, so mos tof them are gonna look to the in-game match making system. That system is Guided Games *beta*! A system so bad and so underdeveloped that it has been in beta since Destiny 2s first raid. Its again, like most of Bungies  good ideas, an under-developed joke.Please make old raids worth while to play. Especially Deep Stone CryptAlso Garden of Salvation is lame as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Eververse  This is just microtransactions for armor and weapon cosmetics. Only complaint here is that this is clearly Bungies main area of focus when it comes to new content and that some exotic weapon ornaments are just shaders tossed on the weapon.

If its so bad, and they \"just cant\" recommend it, then I dont really see why theyre playing it constantly lol.I do agree that for new players, with how its been changed, itd definitely be quite confusing if  you first join. But tbh, they wouldnt know any different to 750 being base level. Bungie shouldve organised the campaigns and how you start the game differently, but lets be honest - its a MASSIVE game, full of content, even without Forsaken or Shadowkeep, and its FREE. So yeah, do at least give it a try. I dont see why people would say otherwise - if you dont like it, at least there was no money wasted.I think how theyve done the \"battle pass\" for D2 is really good, and its good for everyone. If you do buy Shadowkeep, you get the pass included.

If they didnt do that, the game would easily be 350Gigs of space. Now, onto the review. Ive been with this game since D1 launched on Xbox, it is an absolutely great game for any looter shooter fan, any fan of Halo, or any fan of Warframe. The game is very friendly to casual players, with a pretty low skill floor, but can also be the game for players that want some brutally difficult content to absolutely curb stomp mistakes. The game has an absolutely beautiful Original Soundtrack that has made its way into my regularly listened list, a very fun at times, but also pretty dark backstory/Lore, that a lot of fans break down and cover on videos for people to enjoy and such on youtube or elsewhere.The game also has a seasonal content model on top of a yearly expansion model. They release a big expansion once a year, and have 4 mini-expansions/Seasons for each yearly quarter.

The PVP is just completely atrocious. Most matches are completely one sided* You are REQUIRED you to play PVP to get your level up and stuff also some guns are locked behind insane PVP grind* Also PVP matchmaking sometimes takes literally dozens of minutes to find a match.* Maps are way too small or the teams too large, you get a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ton of \"enemies spawning behind you or RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU\" cases* There are insane latency issues in the game most of the time, players in PVP and NPCs just regening HP, running around with 0 hp, teleporting sometimes* You are constantly being booted off from the menus when starting/entering/loading into activities, instead of some visual markers tell the player you have spawned or something. This is especially stupid when you spawn into a social space where there are no enemies that could kill you* There are 2 tabbed menus for certain stuff (Inventory and Map screens, latter of which also has your quests), your friends list is in a different menu with tabs from your clan, your inventory is in a separate tabbed menu from your quests, forcing you to constantly juggle between different menus.* The menus have plenty of stupid animations that you have wait though (for example opening the map) which you have to sit through when juggling though the tabs and menus to see what you need to see* Vey bad use of screen realestate in most menus, theres so much wasted space which could be otherwise be filled with more icons, for example the shader application menu* The shader system is completely dumb as well, you cannot delete a whole shader stack and you cannot see all your owned shaders in the Collection when previewing shaders on a piece of gear and then buy the shader directly there like you should be able to* You cannot join your clanmatess fireteam through Roster or view their loadout without adding them on Steam first.

A MMORPG? Both? Destiny is Destiny.New Light contentIn \"New Light\", the free to play version of the game, you get all the content of the first year of the game for free, which means three story campaigns, three Raids, three classes of which each one has 3 sub-classes with further customization to choose from.On top of that you will be able to visit Earth, our Moon, Titan, Nessus, Io, Mercury, Mars and more fantastic locations in our solar system like the Tangled Shore, which is a wasteland full of scavengers, and the Dreaming City, which used to be the majestic home to the Awoken, who are a differently evolved part of the human race, existing in harmony with darkness and light.On top of that, you get select content from newer expansions, including playable Weapon Forges, the reckoning with the Taken and the Menagerie, a loot factory where you slay enemies for the amusement of the benevolent Cabal Emperor Calus.General Setting In service of the Traveler, a giant entity of the light that has chosen the humans as its guardians, youll slay the servants of the Darkness:  The Vex, which are a sentient liquid that uses robotic vessels and space-time-travel as their means of war  The Hive, who serve higher beings of the darkness under the sword logic, which makes use of dark rituals and implies that power is taken, never given and only the strong survive The Cabal, a race of conquerors on the hunt for as much territory in the universe as they can get their hands on The Fallen, the former vessels of the Traveler, whose race has descended into chaos after it departed their system The Taken, who are a race created by Hive magic and contain corrupted entities of all the existing enemy racesThe games timeline runs parallel to our own, so a year of in-game events is actually a year of time in our world, which makes for a world that feels very alive. Gameplay and Progression  In general, the New Player experience is really good, but the amount of content can be a bit overwhelming at first.At first, youll want to finish the campaigns, which have you explore the unique landscapes the game offers, and after and during this, youll be greeted with a huge pool of legendary gear to find in the world and in different activities, of which many are out in the semi-open world, and others are matchmade with fellow guardians.The Gunplay, in my opinion, is very special. Polished Animations, high quality sound- and particle design make for an experience unlike any other shooter on the market can offer. I can only speak for myself, but I have not played another game where shooting guns was anywhere close to how satisfying it is in Destiny.The Progression happens by collecting powerful gear, its comparable an item level system of other games. You can sacrifice powerful gear to increase the strength of a weaker piece, which means you can keep whatever gun you enjoy shooting and bring it into endgame content if you desire. Theres also a Battle Pass system, which offers rewards for leveling up to both \"paying\" and \"free to play\" players, the former obviously getting a little more, mostly cosmetics though.There are also weapon and armor mods, which enhance certain stats, passives and abilities of your character and gear which makes for great customizationThe Endgame ..consists of a chase of the most Powerful Gear earned from the most challenging activities in the game. All legendary armor comes with random stats which enhance your mobility, health and abilities. All legendary weapons come with a set of possible rolls, so you can have many versions of the same weapon which play completely different. There are plenty of quest-lines involving both PvP, PvE and PvPvE content in order to get some very sweet gear You can upgrade your weapons and armor with materials until they become Masterworks which further improves them. Exotics are the highest tier of loot available in destiny. Armor often fundamentally changes your neutral game or the behavior of your super, allowing many different playstyles Weapons often break boundaries of their archetype, resulting in some crazy looks and gunplay, ranging from giant exploding lasers to a mini-gun that almost never has to stop shooting to a Bow that shoots three arrows at once and chains lighting between enemies.And Raids, oh boy. Raids are also a thing no other shooter has even come close to replicating how they play in Destiny.With a team of 6 players youll tackle gigantic Bosses of all the enemy factions in a multi-stage-activity which usually take between 45 minutes and 1:30hours of time.With teamwork, strategy, skill and communication you and your fireteam will master its challenges which range from intense jumping puzzles, mowing down hordes of enemies while preparing the main Bosses mechanic for the DPS-phase. I could go into more detail but explaining some encounters would probably take as much space as this wall of text already does.So find a Clan on bungie.net, create a fireteam with the official LFG or just meet up with a few friends and tackle the Endgame Challenges. And if you want to check how your gear performs against other guardians, the Crucible is the place for all your PvP needs. You will get salty sometimes, but you will improve eventually as well.  So, should you get the game? If you like shooters OR MMORPGS OR SciFi OR rich lore OR cool Guns, at least give the free version  New Light  a try. Its free, let the game convince you itself.Are the Expansions worth it? If you enjoy the game, very likely. The price is really low compared to the amount of playtime you can get out of the game. 25\u20ac for Forsaken+Annual Pass? Three more raids Played for easily a thousand  hours, starting September 2018 and lasting until now.Shadowkeep and its season pass are a bit pricier because it is new. I fully expect it to last as long as Forsaken did, so 60\u20ac for another year of content.So, in conclusion, Destiny is a great game with aspects that can attract many different kinds of players from the developers who also created the Halo games and started to double down on transparency in the recent months. I cant quite compare it to any other game Ive played, and you should definitely seize the opportunity to give the game a shot for free.

This game puts you in a fantasy world with guns and magic and characters and lore galore. I 100% recommend trying this game for free and then consider investing in future content. The bad and why I dont recommend this game is simple. The core loop of Destiny is doing chores and running errands. You check objectives off your lists and you get rewarded. To yield the best and largest rewards, you should always be buying bounties to complete during all the activities Destiny has to offer. If that doesnt sound up your alley and youd rather spend your time playing other games that feel more rewarding than go ahead! Not everyone has to like everything. Time for the bad thats actually not that bad. These bounties you can get are timed for 24 hours. I think a big problem that is actually very solvable is people feel they have to get all their bounties done immediately after buying them. I used to feel this way and it was a very toxic mindset. Destiny became way more enjoyable when I quit even though I still had bounties left to complete. The good is also simple. Destiny has some of the best gunplay of an FPS out there. Enemies pop. Your guns all sound appropriately designed. The classes and abilities have expanded a huge amount since Vanilla Destiny 1. Even though the core gameplay loop is repeating missions to complete errands, the gunplay is what balances it out. Destiny 2 has given me the looter shooter experience that other kings like Borderlands and Warframe couldnt give me. And its not because the others are bad, I just like how Destinys grind works the most!", "Author": "ReMattch", "Hours": 666.1}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 22, 2019", "Review": "The move to free-to-play removed the only interesting part of the game. They drop you in at what would be considered end-game content in any other MMO style game. There used to be progression and a story to follow as you progressed. Now its just raids/strikes and PVP (unless you want to waste your time running around planets doing inconsequential Patrols or Events). The game is now a hamster wheel of gameplay. At first it felt like I was making some sort of progress, but I quickly ended up just feeling like I was spinning my wheels doing the same boring bounties, public events, and patrols.You start at \"level\" 750 and gear drops around your level, slowly increasing as your own level increases (based on an average of your gears level) until you reach 900. Then, for arbitrary reasons, \"better\" gear becomes much more rare, slowing your \"level\" growth significantly.Now, I put \"level\" and \"better\" in quotes, because its not really true. Your level is completely pointless other than to gate you from content (You must be this tall to ride) and all enemies scale to your level. The game is just as difficult/easy at level 750 as it is at 950 (unless you somehow end up in something that has a higher minimum level, I guess).

PLEASE READ THROUGH UPDATES, AS SOME INFORMATION EARLIER IN THIS REVIEW MAY BE OUT OF DATE.Destiny is the pinnacle looter shooter. So much of its content is available for free that it almost makes no sense to not give it a shot. Despite a rough launch, Destiny 2 has come into its own over the past two years, and it now brings the Destiny franchise to the best place its ever been.Its enjoyable solo, but if you really want to experience all that Destiny has to offer, you need to bring a few friends. The raids are some of the best PvE content out there in any game, let alone an FPS. Master-level activities are tough as nails, but not unfair. For new players, theres a ton of content to explore, including all 3 year-one raid activities, Gambit, all patrol zones, all Crucible playlists, all strikes, and all forge content. When youre ready to jump into paid content, Forsaken holds some of the best story content in the franchise, as well as three more excellent raids. Some of the magic of year 2 is gone now, but the content is all still there.Shadowkeep (and Season of the Undying) thrusts Destiny into a new era, building on the Annual Pass model of Year 2, and is expected to set up a constant feed of content for Year 3. Plenty of new weapons and loot. New, rewarding activities (Vex Offensive drops more loot than you can reasonably deal with), a new raid set in the impossibly beautiful Black Garden, and changes to the way Destiny handles high difficulty that make the most difficult activities in Destiny not only extremely challenging, but amazingly fun and rewarding. Add to that the seasonal Artifact which you can level up to unlock perks of your choosing, augmenting the way you play.Destiny is stupid good right now. Heres hoping that the rest of Year 3 continues to make this game even better.Update: Year 3 has not continued to make this game better. But if youre a new player, youll have a ton to do, and wont start seeing the cracks until youve got a couple hundred hours in. My total playtime across Battle.net and now Steam approaches 2000 hours, so the issues I see now are issues that you arent likely to experience for a while, and may even be resolved by the time you hit that point.Update 2: Season of Arrivals has been pretty great so far. New weapons are very cool, some of them are pretty strong (Falling Guillotine, even post-fix, is amazing. Legendary Dark-Drinker). Its nice to finally see long-teased story beats moving forward. Moments of Triumph has been a boon as well, making 5 of the legacy raids farmable (uncapped rewards per week), as well as guaranteeing those who clear Spire of Stars during this time the best emote in the game. My playtime has skyrocketed during this season versus the last couple seasons, and Im looking forward to Beyond Light.Update 3: Were now nearly halfway through Year 4, with the release of Beyond Light, Season of the Hunt, and now were in the tail end of Season of the Chosen. Year 4 came in hot with a ton of controversial changes, including the \"vaulting\" of all Y1 and some Y2 content, the introduction of weapon and armor sunsetting, and Stasis. Almost 6 months out from the start of the Destiny Content Vault, the removal of Y1 and some Y2 content still stings, if a bit less. Theyre working on fleshing out the strike playlist, which lost a ton of content, but the effects are still felt in the Crucible and Gambit playlists where map variety is at an all-time low. Season of the Hunt was pretty rough, since the seasonal activity was pretty shallow, and forced players to grind out the core playlists, emphasizing the fact that a ton of content was just cleaved from the game. Trials of Osiris has now been back for an entire year, and while the loot added in Season of the Chosen is very good (Messenger with Desperado, Igneous Hammer), the game mode still has accessibility and stinginess issues, and desperately needs measures to increase the population every weekend.On a positive note, there have been plenty of good changes to the game in Year 4. Europa is a gorgeous destination, and without a doubt the largest the franchise has ever seen. The weather system feels downright oppressive at times, and it makes the world feel a bit more authentic. Deep Stone Crypt, the raid that shipped with Beyond Light, is beautiful, fun, exciting, and probably the most accessible raid in Destiny 2. If youre going to sherpa new players into the raiding experience, start here. Select Lost Sectors have been given high-difficulty treatments, and are home to exotic slot target farming, which is wonderful. And, unlike with Year 3, FOMO has been lessened by allowing all Year 4 content to remain in the game until Year 5 begins.Bungie have also been fairly agile in tuning Stasis, which came into the game INCREDIBLY hot. Its still not perfect, as I think the accuracy penalty while slowed needs to go, and Stasis can still win in ways that no other subclass can (one ranged Warlock melee can drop a Thundercrash to the ground like a frozen turd falling out of an airplane), but its certainly better than the horror show it was near the launch of Beyond Light.Since the Destiny Content Vault is not a one-way ticket to the void, weve seen a swathe of returning content from Destiny 1, updated for Destiny 2. Strikes like Will of Crota (updated with a \"new\" boss and new name for narrative reasons), Devils Lair, and Fallen S.A.B.E.R. have returned and been updated with champions for the various Nightfall difficulties which should include them. With these strikes returned, so too has a decent chunk of the Cosmodrome, which is home to the improved new player onboarding experience. In a few months, Destinys first-ever raid, Vault of Glass, will return, along with the promise of harder versions of raids and dungeons.Finally, sunsetting has been sunset. A wildly controversial change, sunsetting was a system by which the game would phase out older gear over time. While it certainly had its merits, and similar systems have been successfully implemented in other MMOs, it often negated the drive to grind for powerful loot, since everything that dropped would now have an expiration date emblazoned on its stat sheet. It also left tons of gaps in weapon archetypes and elements for use in high-end content. This works in other MMOs where weapons are little more than pretty stat sticks, but Destiny weapons have quite a bit of personality and players didnt like being forced to break off relationships with their favorites. This system is gone, and while gear which has already been sunset will remain that way, no future weapons nor armor will be given a hard expiration date when theyre introduced.Once again, were in a place where Destiny is in a pretty good spot. Well see how the rest of Year 4 plays out.Update 4: Witch Queen is out. Campaign (played on Legendary) is easily the best in the Destiny franchise, and possibly even in Bungies history. Dont miss this.", "Author": "Argyel", "Hours": 1763.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 9, 2019", "Review": "So, you want to play a new game and you stumbled on Destiny 2. A use to be paid for game with expensive expansions. Destiny 2 now has basically two versions of the game New Light, and the game with the most recent expansions. When you first load into Destiny 2: New Light you have 3 options on which class you can play.Titan: Titan is in my opinion the best class in every activity. Their subclass abilities can be good in any scenario, so if you want to be well rounded pick titan.Warlock: Warlocks use to be the best class for raiding, but they nerfed Luna (basically auto reloading exotics for your whole team) Warlocks are still useful in some high level activities, but not as much as they use too. Warlocks are really good for crucible though. With their dawnblade (Solar Subclass) when you use dawnblade you become the fastest class in the game. You also regain super energy with every kill whilst in the super.Hunter: Hunters are my favorite class, but right now they are probably the worse for raiding. They dont have anything bad about them, they just dont provide that much support or help unless hunters use their void subclass Shadowshot. Shadowshot basically gives you a tether ability as your super which gives your team increased damage and add control. Adds are just the minions basically. Hunters are pretty good in the crucible as a shutdown super type, but you need forsaken to use the Blade Barrage Super.After you choose your character you are dropped into a mission right away. This mission is your so called tutorial mission. It shows how your weapons work and your abilities. After you complete this rather easy mission youll be thrown into the destiny world. Youll be sent into the TowerWhen the game sends you into the Tower it basically acts like the main hub i.e. where you get most if not all your quests and a bunch of other stuff. When you first load in you can do about 3 things. You can head to your left to the hanger and start the destiny 2 campaign up to the campaign for Warmind. If you choose not to start the campaign right away you can start collecting all the quests that the game gives you in the tower, now it may seem like a load of quests for just beginning and it kinda is, but most of the quests are basically get started quests. The more you do the basic quests the more you get access too, this is a good way to start out if you need to learn how the game works with all the different activities ( I recommend this the most). The third option is honestly just going into orbit and letting your friends help you throughout the game.After you do one of these options you are basically free to go have fun in the world of Destiny, but you might still need to unlock some of the planets. Destiny 2: New Light works in a way were the longer you play the more you unlock, so say you did the base campaign for Destiny 2 and you still need to unlock mars. If you still need to unlock some of the planets you need to do any activity that gives you experience examples are crucible, gambit and strikes.New players to Destiny 2. You have so much to do and get done, so go out there and have fun most of all!For returning Destiny 2 players who have all the expansions for Destiny 2, including Shadowkeep. Youll have a bit to do with Shadowkeep. First of all every single character even new start out at 750 power and level 50 to reduce the grind. With Shadowkeep you first have to do the short story which does kinda suck how short it is, but the story has massive lore significance wont go into detail. After you beat the campaign you should hopefully be at about 900 power, now this when you remember what destiny 2 was like when you needed to grind for power. If you own Shadowkeep that also means you get Season of the Undying which comes with a new raid with Vex being the main enemy.Basically Destiny 2 has way too much to put into a single review, but I tried to explain the basics of Destiny 2 for the new players, and who are returning with Shadowkeep.

The narrative flow and introduction to gameplay systems is now more cohesive and informative. For old players, my recommendation stands. The removal of content has been thoroughly discussed since it was announced with various degrees of approval, so I dont need to say much about it. I will say that the new content is good so far, and theres enough here to keep us busy for a while. I believe that Destiny is in pretty good shape for new and old players. I previously rated this game not recommended based on the new player experience, but Ive now revised that to recommended. *Original Review*At this moment, I cannot recommend this game to new players. For old players, Destiny 2 is in a great state, and all the changes and new content are overall great. If youve been playing, I can definitely recommend that you keep playing.  But for new players, the introduction to this game will be absolutely awful. Previously, the content flow was as you would expect from a game with a lot of lore and a lot of various gameplay systems. You started out with the main campaign, and as you progressed, you would be gradually introduced to various systems: weapons, skills, level/light level, various activities. All that good stuff. The campaign not only provided the context for the world, your character and all the NPCs hanging around that you interact with frequently, it was a tutorial for how Destiny functioned.  But Bungie is now guiding players away from the campaign, and thus the proper tutorial, and just throwing all new characters into the post campaign environment with zero context for whats going on story wise (and story is very important to many players, whether Bungie wants to acknowledge that or not), and extremely brief explanations for all Destinys complex gameplay systems.  Countless new players are complaining of being lost and confused, and they are absolutely right to complain. This was a serious mistake on Bungies part.  So heres the solution: give players a clearly explained choice of where to start in this game. Let them choose between the original starting point for new players, in the Red War at LL 0, or if they want to skip all of that and jump to the endgame environment as new players currently do. But this option should come with a clear explanation that without playing the campaign, they will have no context for much of the content as it does heavily reference the main campaign as well as the DLC campaigns.

Out of all the employees at bungie theres like 3 people actually doing work and its all on microtransactions. The rest of them make a new reskinned piece of gear or port a gun from Destiny 1 once a month. Usually around the same time the guy who fixes bugs comes in for two hours. The game feels great but the devs are always preoccupied with forcing the meta in the direction they want it to go in instead of just making quality content.  eg. pvp being perfectly fun except nobody used scout rifles. So what do they do? They nerf every weapon category except for scouts, make the seasonal challenge be one for a scout, requiring the use of scouts, and then the subsequent season the seasonal exotic is a scout. The guns in this game feel like theyre made out of legos and you can tell none of the designers have ever shot a gun or know how they work. For example, the fully automatic shotguns requiring a pump after letting go of the fire button. Or when all the switch fire modes involve reloading. The summit of Destiny 2 was after Forsaken. Lots of new mechanics, lots of new content, everything was fun and had some sort of rewarding aspect. But now, theyve started a new model for future content with Shadowkeep. Every season theres a crappy half-baked activity with no worthwhile reskinned guns and every meta item is an exotic or a Forsaken pinnacle weapon. Did I mention they removed pinnacle weapons because they were too meta-changing? Now we get ritual weapons with crappier stats and perks than weapons already available. And dont get me started on the grinding. Before, youd have to do a weekly mission that was unique and in rotation maybe once every six to three weeks.

CofO and warmind, I paid for them. Anyways, with the deluxe I got the pre-order bonus (because yes, sadly, I Preordered it) the cold hearth, sure the gun was meta for the first raid boss yada yada, now the gun is absolute garbage and cant be used anywhere efficiently and it got removed from my account because apparently theres a bug in the game that if you didnt drop the weapon prior the vault update, it wont show up in your inventory, cmon now is it that hard to do something right, especially when you charge this much for a game.

Theyre basically milking you for the same game you bought 4 times already.Sure, im being kinda biased with me getting screwed, I must admit , I love looter shooters , the stories rather short and bare of content, are actually pretty fun.

Honestly Destiny is at its prime in my opinion, now that Bungie has \"broken up\" with Activision you see what Bungie  is allowed to do now that they are in full control of the path of the game and the game now has a great path of accomplishment. The list of accomplishments i feel i have on this game go on forever, like earning the pinnacle/ritual weapons. The biggest thing i like about this game is, its a constant competition for whos better, me and my friends literally go back and forth on this game to see whos better, and it even comes down to if i look cooler. Plus the season pass (added in shadowkeep) gives me a reason to keep playing the game even after i feel i have \"done everything\" the season pass adds a great way to feel progression in the game as well, it allows a whole slew rewards for just 10$, and simply you get rewards from the season pass from doing anything you normally do in Destiny. Another topic that needs to be talked about is the diverse story-telling Bungie does with Destiny, of course a downside to the giant story is...if you want to know it, truly, you have to dig into lore tabs, and pair that with what already happens in the campaigns. But aside from having to dig to find the story, the story is beyond anything i expected it was when i started playing.

The game fails to introduce you to subclasses and skills, completely. The bounties are a horrible progression system, considering they are time based. Almost every activity feels as if its pressuring in one way or another. What little story Ive had so far has been highly uninteresting, most of it seemingly assuming you know the backlore of every single little NPC in the entire game, as well as the dynamics between the factions, and their history. End-game is apparently a pretty fun grind. Getting there, however, really isnt. And im not spending hundreds of hours just to get to the good stuff.I thought Warframe had issues... But Destiny 2 takes the cake. Pretty much anything that is similar between the games, Warframe does better. The few things that really set the games apart, still makes me favor Warframe. That last bit is just preference, but the quality of life stuff and much better thought out features in Warframe are painfully obvious when playing Destiny 2.All that said, its really not a bad game. The gunplay is fine, it plays smooth and theres a lot of content. I just never found satisfaction in the things one should get satisfaction in an action MMO such as this. Which would be the gunplay, the progression and getting stronger and etc. Sadly the gunplay, while good, feels meaningless in a world where everything is based on power level of your gear. Your ability to aim makes very little difference. And the progression directly ties into that, with you never really noticing if you get stronger or not, as EVERYTHING scales, and the gear progression system being one weak ass basic feature to begin with.If you played this, and never played Warframe, go play Warframe.If you tried Warframe, and never tried this, give it a try, then go back to Warframe.If you tried neither, just skip em both and go enjoy the sun instead.

But if Bungie manages to wipe 80% of the game and makes my whole clan, including me, quit the game indefinitely, although we used to play for hours every day (I reached season rank 666 before Beyond Light released), theres no way this is just a dry phase. They \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up the entire game severely and beyond repair in a matter of ONE update.Nobody can deny that the gunplay is amazingly smooth and that the worlds you can explore look beautiful. Here, we face the first issue though: before Beyond Light, this game was more than just a grindy, boring and repetitive checklist and a bounty simulator. We had a solid story campaign, two DLC planets, namely Mercury and Mars, we had adventures and rotating daily story missions. Destiny is a pve game, it cant survive without its story and lore. Now for completely braindead reasons, Bungie looked at the player numbers and saw that hardly anyone was playing this content (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 New Light players I guess?). But why is that so? Could it be that getting two blues and some XP is not a good reward for playing an entire campaign? Naaaaah, lets just stop using our micro-brains and REMOVE one of the most important aspects of the game! You hear me right, new players in Beyond Lite never get to experience the base story explaining the necessary context. The Red War campaign from Destiny 2 Vanilla, the Curse of Osiris and the Warmind DLC got eliminated entirely without replacement, although players paid 59.99$ + 16.99$ + 19.99$ for this content. The fun doesnt end here, you thought you can at least keep the planets? WRONG, they were removed as well along with all their exotic quests, activities and secrets! Now you may think: \u201eHey, at least I can enjoy Forsaken and Shadowkeep, two big DLCs with lots of content and fun.\u201c Well you actually can, but prepare for not being able to use your loot in the new DLC. You heard me right, you pay another 40$ each for having the weapons and armours expiration cap set to 1060. This cancerous idea called \u201esunsetting\u201c is one of the main reasons I quit the game. Literally ALL of your hard-earned loot that is older than 3 seasons (=1 year) has become USELESS. If you keep using it, enemies become immune due to your low powerlevel, as Bungie increases the max power level every season (pretending it to be content). Your powerful and unique pinnacle weapons, hard to get or tedious to grind, suddenly cant kill \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 anymore, simply because of a meaningless number. I consider the fact that you can buy expensive DLCs, but cant use their guns now, as scam. DO NOT BUY FORSAKEN OR SHADOWKEEP. I feel so sorry for all the designers of the old loot and content which has become meaningless now. After all, who wants to play old activities like the Shattered Throne or nightmare hunts if your loot drops far below your power level? They even removed FIVE RAIDS, the pinnacle of pve, for no reason and consider sunsetting subclasses now, WTF?! The damage sunsetting has done to this game and the motivation to grind in general is mindboggling. If no item can be used longer than 3 seasons, why grind for a god roll in the first place and waste stupidly expensive upgrade materials on it? If every unique pinnacle weapon, symbolizing commitment, skill and endurance, has become useless and/or been nerfed to ground, why even bother getting it in the first place?? Bungie thought of this as well and made all the iconic weapons players spent hundreds of hours on available to PURCHASE in a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ingame kiosk, slapping the playerbase in the face one more time. Although entire planets were made useless or purged in Beyond Light, their pvp maps didnt, bringing it in line with Bungies amazing narrative... This was actually the first time pvp wasnt screwed over LMAO. So you might think: \u201eHey, Im a pvp main, maybe I dont need a good pve and just enjoy a fairly balanced and competetive pvp with good rewards and a dynamic meta?\u201c Sorry to dissappoint you again, if you are mad enough to start the \u201ecrucible\u201c, Destiny\u00b4s brilliant player vs cheater mode, you will deal with the following: no relevant loot, a shotgun/melee meta since year two, players teleporting across the map/not taking damage, error codes disconnecting you right before the match ends, ability crutches instead of gunplay, losing melee battles although you punched first, losing despite of dropping 50 kills cuz team balancing is utterly garbage, and New Light players with a 96% headshot accuracy wrecking streamers. The pinnacle of fun, however, is facing Stasis, the perfectly balanced class Beyond Light gave us. You will get frozen every 10 seconds, cant move or shoot at all for some seconds, while the enemy is teabagging your frozen statue. All the matches revolve around your ability recharge rates and chucking stasis at each other. It\u2019s literally infinite freezing without any counterplay. Losing control over your character, apparently, is the definition of fun for Bungie devs so they dont feel the need to listen to the communitys or streamers feedback who called these problems even before release. Considering you have to pay a small amount of 60$ for Beyond Light and its season, it has to be the ultimate gaming experience replacing all of the removed stuff, right? RIGHT? Well, if you enjoy a short 5 hour campaign followed by ridiculously lazy game design, bounty grinding, lost sector grinding, grinding old and boring activities over and over while fighting for kills with your team mates, and last but not least, getting screwed over by error codes, glitches and things not working as intented, go ahead. Forsaken provided content for months, in Beyond Grind however I was done after two weeks and all that is left is bright dust farming (the ingame currency to buy cosmetics) by doing the same old crap for the 1000th time (speaking of bright dust, you are only allowed to earn half of the amount you used to get before this update, so you run out of this rare currency faster and have to spend more real money). Dont even bother trying to do one of the few challenging activities legit, the game is such a buggy mess that literally every triumph, every emblem, every badge can be cheesed, devaluing prior gamers\u00b4 achievements. Instead of implementing anti-cheat, dedicated servers or RNG protection, Bungie devs prefer ignoring critical feedback and only listen to the compliments. If everything is going downhill like right now, they retreat and start posting stupid memes on Twitter instead of fixing their damn game. So much potential, so much content, so much fun gone to waste just because of incredibly stupid game design. As a die-hard Destiny fan, I feel betrayed and fooled, dumping so much time and money in this game which is clearly designed for casuals since it became free to play. Paradoxically, there is near to no content left to play for new players. I doubt this game will ever return to its roots that made Destiny 1 legendary, too many people buy silver and get satisfied by primitive grinding. The countless players and content creators who quit definitely dont, though.

Beyond Light has come out and personally? I thought Id give the game a new chance, seeing as I hoped theyd have listened to the people who were giving their opinions about the game and its flaws. So, what better way to get back into the franchise by buying Shadowkeep and Forsaken to see if the remaining DLC are still replayable.Boy was that a mistake on my part.I never got to play Forsaken back in the day, before Beyond Light, because I had a lot of my time taken up by more pressing issues so I decided that yesterday was a good day to start it to see how the community was holding together. Especially seeing as almost every review for Beyond Light was stating it wasnt worth the 70 dollars, so I wasnt going to spend my money on that for the time being.Forsaken was praised back in the day for how great it was, but now? Its a husk of what it used to be. DLC should be replayable and this is far from being such a thing. I managed to beat the ENTIRE campaign (next to the last Petra Quest) in under 6 hours. That is NINE bosses, in EIGHT hours. Thats not even half an hour per boss, if you include the bounties I had to complete to get the Spider to trust me in the first place. The new light level has left Forsaken absolutely desolate. The bosses are lack luster and overall, the only good thing to come out of it was killing the guys who killed Cayde and getting his sparrow. The thing that makes the Questline barely worth while though is the fact that, cause of all the old planets being removed, you can no longer obtain Caydes weapon from the quest like before. This is a BIG slap to the face, cause the quest barely provides any gear in the first place.Which - mind you, it makes no sense, seeing as in the last cutscene you literally HAVE the weapon in your hand. What the hell do you do with it? Shove it into a pocket dimension so it goes into the exotic vault?? The bosses themselves were lackluster honestly, they were defeated easily and I only recently got back into the game. So that really says something overall, you think theyd atleast make the enemies take longer. The only enemy I actually had difficulties with was the last one, thank god. But honestly? Fighting them all over again sounds like a boring train wreck, which just ruins the whole point of DLC.

This list is by no means exhaustive, but also potentially the rantings of a madman.The Crucible, Shaxx\u2019s arena to test a Guardian\u2019s might or their connection to the host. \u2013 The matchmaking is atrocious, if you aren\u2019t matchmaking people from other continents with far superior connections or connections plugged into a bucket of water, you are with a serious mismatch of skill levels.If that doesn\u2019t make you want to rage quit, the sheer number of FTP hackers will. Why can\u2019t we have anti cheat? Don\u2019t know. Why does matchmaking take so long? Don\u2019t know. Why can\u2019t we have dedicated servers? Don\u2019t know. Why do matches start with a 2 v 3 and you are expected to play it out or be penalised for leaving yourself? Don\u2019t know. If you are 5 v 5 and losing why do they give the winning team the extra player? Don\u2019t know. They actually had match making pretty good a few seasons ago (about S9-10) but we can\u2019t have a good thing for too long. Why are the rank up banners still so big that they take up your bloody screen? Don\u2019t know. Also, why does it keep kicking me out of the menu when flying in to an activity? Dont know, Maybe just have one kick at the start of the match.Why are we still prevented from leaving matches as soon as they finish and have to go through the animations of garbage for post-match? Why can\u2019t we skip these menus like other AAA FPS titles? Don\u2019t know. At least they fixed all the black screens they introduced between matches. Bravo Bungie.Now off to PVE where the season pass model is in its 3rd successful year. When I say successful, I mean successful for making Bungie the maximum profits with the players getting the least content.  We used to get 2+ raids a year and those were good times, now we are lucky with one and a quarterly hoard mode activity which outwears its welcome in a matter of days.Constantly introducing Nerf\u2019s to weapons and abilities and anything that brings any kind of small joy to this title instantly, but leave crucible issues for 12+ months outstanding. Like how hackers can ruin countless Flawless tickets on the last win. But nah, it\u2019ll be fine, we must nerf swords again, our Ads are getting killed.We didn\u2019t know how good we had it in Forsaken, 3 great raids, new interesting stories and guns, lots of guns. Those guns carried us for a long time, until Bungie thought it great to introduce Sun setting. No not the lovely kind that you sit down the beach watching with the love of your life. The kind where the darkness is encroaching and all your loved ones (guns) leave for no reason at all other than Bungie wants you to play how they want you too.Seriously, it is frustrating to see Bungie 180 on their decisions and commence nerfing everything and anything that gives players a slight edge in PVE. Almost like every raid boss must be a fight over several phases to extend playtimes, rather making unique new challenging bosses. Also, what is with the hard limit on materials? Why is my vault still only 500 spaces? Why is Luke Smith still in charge of this title? Don\u2019t know.If it isnt the weekly lip service of Luke Smith and the other devs, completely ignoring the issues at any present moment and making things worse and worse to the point that they then bring stuff back to original or a previous version. Not long before nerfing it again... bright dust economy, cough cough.But there is the obvious comment most will mention, just play something else. Well, at this point, I\u2019ve sunk far too many hours into this game since D1 that I am invested and I genuinely want this game to be good, the blueprint is right there for Bungie to enact, but they consistently make changes in the opposite direction. Like introducing game breaking bugs every update.Seriously Bungie, who is testing your builds? Is it a monkey in the basement? Someone call PETA.

The story seemed meh over all most of the stuff were reused from previous years but after the story ended it transitioned into a raid which is the main reason I play this game, the raid and its endgame content. After a few weeks a new dungeon was released and it was not really that good, as it took couple of weeks everyone was at high light level but the light level requirement for this activity was really low. Some people even did solo flawless in the first day, which is running the 3 man activity as a solo player without dying from start to end.I bought the deluxe edition so I had also the seasons with it. As much as I was looking forward for the seasons for new content each season had less to do then the one before it. I expected the first one to be low on content as we had a lot to do with the main dlc but the second and the third lacked also content. The game turned into a bounty simulator as the main activities and the main source of xp comes mostly from them. The current season was the biggest disappointment, we got a public event and a higher level lost sector which is like a small cave with some enemies and a boss at the end as the main activities. We also got trials which sounded good on paper but with all the disconnections and cheater I had to switch on my ps4 to get a ticket done. In conclusion I dont even know why I gave it a positive feedback maybe because I want it to successed but I am loosing home.

The game is beautiful, especially all the story mission, if you dont rush trough them and try to enjoy the art you will definitely like it. There is alot of lore to explore, most planets have special items to scan wich give you more information about how it came there, all rare items have tooltip lore. Some missions are really good. Some exotics quests are intresting and fun to do. Certain gamemodes are kinda fun to do with friend (gambit, crucible, strikes) and if you can collect a party to do raids you are golden. Whats bad? The endgame is trash, the only thing fun is raids and PvP, but PvP is almost always good because it has the best replayablity. Season 10 didnt bring anything exicting. There is little room for customization and it isnt incentivised. If you start playing the game as a new player you wont have any exotics and many intresting builds are locked behind exotics. I played hunter for about 120 hours and after taking a look at warlock I felt like hunter was garbage. None of their exotics are intresting. Warlock is just superior in everything. The game isnt new player friendly because alot of important things are gated behind storyline. They introduced new mods wich just feel annoying and cluncky. You have to have a certain mod to kill a certain enemy, but in order to put the mod on, your item has to have a mod socket (wich most dont - even exotics dont have them), you must have a certain type of weapon and you have to have the mod unlocked. This once again discourages customization of your gaurdians build. Bounties are the name of the game, and most of the time the bounties arent even fun to execute. They ask you once again to change your loadout and use forgotten weapon types.

The gun-play, music, and art are top notch, unfortunately for me, thats where the positives end and are the only reasons i still play.  The pve and pvp playlists are both extremely stale at this point, most strikes are not worth running. The enemy density is pathetic, so you are constantly fighting your allies to get kills so that you can even experience the only good part of the game. PvP is a joke with the most unbalanced sandbox I have ever seen, some weapon types are completely unusable because they are dominated by hand cannons and shotguns and this has been a recurrent theme for years now.

The developers finally added the long requested transmog system, yknow that thing that most MMOs have innately from the get-go. It took them 6 YEARS to add this and it was implemented so raw that I wouldnt even call it half-baked.

Activision funding, Bungie developers, over two years since release and this is STILL a multi-layered mess of a sh*t sandwich. Ive now played this game on 4 different occassions with 3 different rigs and it is nothing but an astonishment on just how brutally mismanaged this game is along with how little love has actually been put into polishing this title. Want to know the hows and whys? Read on.1. Pay To Win Much to my surprise after the initial wave of controversies in 2017 and them now subsequently going F2P as a \"fresh start\" opportunity, Bungie has decided to only partially restructure how they are giving out very tangible, hard advantages to people who spend money into the game. This time around, it is now present in the Season Pass where right from the get-go at level one, youll be getting an exotic weapon, armor and more: https://i.imgur.com/g5WX7SE.pngAnd beyond that, it is a consistent, generous shower of legendary engrams, upgrade components, stacks of currency, legendary armor pieces and even exotic engrams: https://i.imgur.com/kHgjVbz.png  - While this is an improvement of what was before, there is still a distinct p2w element even if some of it is locked behind playing the game.. And now i am not mentioning the PAY-WALLED DLC ABILITIES: https://i.imgur.com/ErHHPei.png2. Demolished RedesignFollowing the re-release here on Steam, Bungie threw a bunch of stuff into the dumpster with nothing to replace them and nowhere is this more obvious than the beginning of the game. Youre squeezed through a stupidly short tutorial and then youre given a swift kick to the rear out into the open world, being given the \"power level\" of 750. Having forgotten most of what i previously experienced, me as a REOCCURING player had the following questions pop up into my head \"What the f*ck am i doing? What am i supposed to be doing? Whats the story again? Who are these guys im shooting? Where the hell am i?\" and the list goes on.Turns out they completely ripped out the entire starting campaign instead of adding a \"skip\" button and hid it behind a singular, seemingly random NPC that you have to go talk to if you want some actual backstory or context to your situation.. And there is no incentive for you to do this actual campaign besides information as they didnt bother adding any sort of reward to completing it. What the actual f*ck have you been smoking, Bungie? NEW STOREFRONT. NEW PLAYERS. RETURNING PLAYERS WITH NO MEMORY.3. Bungies Modus OperandiRemember when Bungie went out of their way to implement a system where your progression would be strangled to a complete halt in the most deceptive way possible by showing you false numbers and other shady sh\u00ect? Yeah, that happened and was a thing for a very long time before users started getting wise by looking at things under a microscope and subsequently calling them out on it once it was discovered.. Which they only then removed to avoid backlash.This kind of backwaters snake-oil bullsh*t is something i have absolutely ZERO tolerance for. It is blatant fraud which they spent time, money and effort to put into the game instead of doing any of the plethora other possible options to slow player progression - if they so wished for it. \"BUT ITS REMOVED NOW!!!\" I hear you saying. Maybe so, but what OTHER things are they doing? What has it been replaced with? Which similar things are they planning? Well never know because they have now openly been exposed to be a set of developers (and now publishers) with zero transparency or even goodwill towards their user base.4. Technical TrainwreckThis is the big one that im gonna have to break up into sub-categories. Destiny 2 is a game in severe need of system reworks all the way from the ground up and unfortunately, its never going to get this much needed love as they already have a lifespan plan for the game while also working in-house on another project.A) Servers & Networking: Despite having done very extensive testing on their servers during their time on battlenet, the launch of the game (12h~ lockdown + emergency maintenance) and subsequent days afterwards (now) have some serious stability problems which to my knowledge after some testing of my own is currently the cause of a lot of peoples crashes while also greatly increasing certain loading times.B) Client Performance: Its garbage almost across the entire board. The game runs poorly de-facto with there being little to no evidence that theres been actual optimization efforts at all outside the tutorial. Lowering the options have absolutely minimal impacts with some settings being locked to medium or higher. MANY people with extremely high-end PCs are struggling to run the game at all. Stable 4K is currently considered impossible by most enthusiasts.Consistency is non-existent - Me and other people can have stable 120+ FPS in some zones & maps just to chug down to below 30 in others, even if its the same level of combat intensity. Loading times are at a state borderlining equal to GTA Vs release. The game is at a bloated 82ish GB size with consoles reporting a 60+ GB increase for shadowkeep alone. The game faces HEAVY mouse-lag problems if the polling rate exceeds 500 (ton of gaming mice, if not most, have a standard of 1000). Inputs suffer from significant ghosting which becomes particularly crippling if you use things like burst rifles and the list just goes on.5. Design IdiocyThis will be perhaps the more opinionated section of this review but im gonna provide examples and hopefully youll see what i mean.A) Enemy Scaling: Ever thought it was a bit weird how enemies never seem to get any weaker as you get stronger through better gear? Thats because they get stronger if you do.. Which means that the entire RPG element of this game is completely fake & fabricated. Youre doing repetitive tasks like a monkey to push your arbritrary number up and get rewarded by random gear pieces and a new map unlocking every now and then if youve been real good, depending on how much XP you have accumulated. If you take a second to look at this system from afar, it is the most pointless, deceptive, patethic waste of time and effort on the planet.B) Difficulty: Destiny 2 isnt difficult. At all. This has a number of factors as to why this is, but the most prominent one is that its a console port. PC Players besides their superior looks, genes, muscles and sexual prowess also have a benefit of using a vastly superior control scheme (especially for a shooter) which leads to an already easy casual game becoming a complete snore-fest. This is all due to the AI being grossly simple and incompetent. Going into this game several times with ignorance, I was never at any point remotely surprised by anything any enemy did. Ever. On-top of this, you also have the funny situation where there is still aimbot in the game on things like melee attacks - which you can spam, reducing the already tiny punishments of failure like not managing your ammo. Death has no consequence either as you can spawn in as little as 3 seconds afterwards.. But they ALSO added a patch buffing next to all PvE weapon damages across the board sometimes as much as 50% in the 2.5.2.3 update. Comparing Destiny 2s difficulty to most other games makes it a joke.6. StoryIts complete irredeemable trash.

Destiny is always being that repetitive game that the community love and hate, its one of the best shooting games out there despite the PVP being a little bit chaotic cause everyone has a power to basically 1 hit everyone. Since the release of Forsaken now you have a total of 3 subclasses for each classes that you can switch anytime you want which is cool plus the newest expansion introduced you dark class which might expand to more subclasses in later expansion.But Destiny 2 as a design is really really bad, the leveling system is a mess the actual level is non-existent and they have this soft cap and hard cap where when you at this certain power level (gear level) you need to get a powerful engram by playing certain activities and those activites will only get you some every week, this system forced you to play daily like a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 mobile games and it took you a lot of time to get to the max power level and when you finally hit the highest power level it doesnt even matter cause in the next expansion the max power level will change so you need to do it all over again. This is such a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 way to keep the game alive, because people are doing it like they have a job to do. Sometimes we enjoy it but most of the time we dont and through the recent update they got rid of the main story. Yes, the main Destiny 2 story called The Red War is now gone because theyre trying to prevent the size of the game to bulb like Warzone but why the main story? Newcomers will certainly have no idea what this game about, they dont even have access to Destiny 1 on PC because its only available on console. So this game is now just a generic free MMO FPS game that you might want to try to just mess around with your friends and then delete it cause its so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 boring.If youre new to this franchise you might enjoy it because you have this sense of new experience, but i assure you not in a long term, not at this current state.

Bungie decided to completely remove over 150 dollars worth of expansion products I purchased without my permission because of greed, more than likely. Three or Four of the planets I was enjoying were completely removed from the game once I returned to play after a long period of time. One of the features I love about Steam is the ability to come back to enjoyable titles when I am fully ready to dive back in after a long break. This theft of purchased property is way worse than pay to win. It is pay to lose the features you love. Unfortunately, I will never be returning to play a Bungie game, because it is obvious that it is all about the money and about catering only to players who play 12 hours a day, every day, on Destiny 2 exclusively.Okay...so...that was my rant back when I was disappointed about the removal of content from Destiny 2 during Beyond Light. Months later, I have returned to the game and realized that my view of the game was very jaded by my westernized, entitlement mentality.I am starting to see that Destiny 2 is doing something very different than most online games. I see that they are trying to give us an evolving world that changes all the time rather than remaining constant and permanently like what it would have been 5 months in between times logged into the game. At first, I was incredibly frustrated with Bungie, but then I started to remember what Bungie did for the first person shooter world. They gave us Halo.I really do not know any person, ever, who has complained about Halo.So, after thinking about the idea that my 150 dollars I spent on the game and its expansions were stolen from me, I am now somewhat on the optimistic side and thinking about how I contributed to the Destiny franchise by \"investing\" in the game. Now, it is not like I hold stocks with Bungie (maybe I should), but I do believe there is some value in helping make the franchise what it is today by supporting the game. In addition to all this, I have come to realize that there is a lot less removed from the game with the release of  The Witch Queen than so many Youtubers were saying there would be. I can still access  the Moon campaign if I own Shadowkeep, I can still access a huge amount of Europa and the Beyond Light campaign, and I still get to have The Witch Queen on Mars. Guys, I know that I am in the guilty camp of criticizing one of the greatest Devs out there because I lost content, but I think we can all agree that there is something exciting about logging into a game and seeing a different world, as though we were a bear that hibernated through the winter to find the berries growing in the spring time. :) Think about it. Imagine that you lived in the world of Destiny 2 and you decided to go MIA for a year while other Guardians were saving the galaxy. You would miss a lot of stuff too, and things would inevitably be radically different for you. You would come back from your long, lonely hiatus only to realize that you were weaker and less equipped than those who braved the hostilities of alien encounters for the past year. You would realize that your time away from battle caused you to feel a little rusty and disoriented. I am beginning to see what Bungie is doing here, guys...Do you prefer playing a game like World of Warcraft, in which every time you wanted to create a new human to try a different class, you had to suffer through the twilight zone of Elwynn Forest OVER and OVER and OVER again? Or do you want to play a game where quality and life and everything in the galaxy changes and evolves with the times? You decide. Let me know what you think.Oh yeah...and did we ever really OWN Distiny 2? We are privileged to play it and take part in a Masterpiece.

Its almost a weakness of Destiny 2 that it appears to have very little content at first, the thing is that you have to discover the content yourself, it doesnt list it all out like most games.Graphics are very good, highly detailed, and motion and combat are smooth.  There are tons of weapons that allow you to choose whatever path you want, and they all give a great sense of effectiveness.  Blasts, bolts, bullets and other effects are very well animated. I found the quest system on Destiny 2 horrible. There is almost no information. It will give vague description, often no locations, nothing. There isnt a mini-map and limited guidance to the next step. A lot of the time they wont even tell you the planet the quest is on. They are very definitely the worst quests in any game I have ever played and I can see this putting a lot of people off the game completely. The game is just unbelievably confusing. Part of the reason is it uses a very weird vernacular, and just doesnt explain anything. Dont think you can speed your way through this lot, it takes a lot of research and even on youtube \"answers\" tend to be as garbled and confused and more important, out of date! In general the experience is \"frustrating\". The game is mostly PVE but does have PVP as well. A small number of quests are mixed - they start as PVE can end as PVP. While its often possible to multiplayer solo activities its not possible to solo  multiplay activities. This I see as a major failing that they really should do something about. In general the multiplayer activities are good. The players have a tendency to run ahead trying to kill everything themselves because most of the activities are scored, but most of the time its nothing like as bad as Warframe.Many of the quests are deliberately hidden. These are for the very rare weapons. Dont think a trip to youtube will sort you out! Many span huge maps, require many hours of practice, and include lots of running, fighting, and jumping. These are very well balanced quests and despite the fact that I dislike timed and jumping quests, they are really enjoyable. There are far too many currencies and different procedures, which is really mind numbing. To make it even worse, the introductory story quest is somewhat hidden. Find Amanda Holliday in The Tower ( when you get there ) and she has the main story quest ( including the stories for the two DLCs ) Run it!! It gives you everything you need to know and is absolutely essential for a new players. I was some 50 hours in and completely confused until I found it!! Even that advice will probably be out of date in six months time :/The biggest difference between Destiny 2 and Warframe is that Warframe concentrates on creating and levelling classes ( Warframes). Destiny 2 concentrates on weapons and gear.  Getting weapons in Warframe is easy, not so in Destiny. It can be an enormously difficult and long quest to get a single gun. Ultimately, the downfall of the game is the writers have failed to come up with enough targets for you to achieve. The game is repetitive. Also some targets require a team, which is not always possible. Having said that, there is still plenty of play before you get bored! Despite all the issues, if you are prepared to struggle at first and put the effort in, its a very rewarding game. Just expect a really steep learning curve at first. I have to admit that I nearly gave up with it several times in the first hundred hours or so, but once you work out what its all about, its a very good game. Recommended, but not for the impatient!!

A plot that is (unfortunately, if you believe the stories) influenced by their time with ActiBlizz (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 china, Yay HK). It hits mostly the same beats, with their own twists, that Halo did. You know the deal; theres more going on here than we first thought, major world and world view shattering implications.The gunplay is slick and solid, again as expected from Bungie. There are a decent chunk of weapons that are not random and a decent chunk that are. The hunt for gear and weapons, depending on your own investment and tolerance for it, is deceptively long and deep (hahaha, bow chicka bow wow). If a particular weapon that you take a liking to happens to be one with random rolls, you can spend ages finding the perfect version with the perfect perks. Its not Borderlands, and thank \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 for that (the writer would like to disclose his disdain for Borderlands but wishes not to expound on it).The classes are equally varied but not so much that they entirely change the gameplay. Titan, Warlock, Hunter.In big picture terms each class brings between 1-3 super abilities to the game, these take time and if you so decide, a bit of extra effort in order to use them more frequently, to the game. Each class super abilities tend to range from single-target to group-damage alongside the occasional healing/buffing utility or something thats a bit of its own beast.It would be worthwhile looking into these in more detail if it interests you but youre on the fence about trying the game.The content is... lots? The words Id like to use escape me right now. Its kind of a case of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING LOADS and also SORT OF NOT ENOUGH? if you were to consider the entire scope of the game as one giant open world then the open world itself would be very small, but at the same time packed to bursting with things to do. Even for a F2P player. Though in regards to critisism, the game does a poor job of clearly defining these lines and providing F2P players with a clear distinction, up front, of what they can and cannot expect. The weekly version of nightfalls springs to mind personally. The FAQ says that all Strikes are F2P content, but if the WEEKLY version of a nightfall happens to be a Forsaken or Shadowkeep Strike, then youre a bit SOL until it lands on something included in the F2P rotation. On the other hand, in the regular strike playlist, you are not limited. If you sign up for it and it happens to put you into an expansion only strike then hey, have fun! Its all yours. Small discrepancies like these should be further expanded upon in a more immediately understandable way for the benefit of Free players. And IMO, the weekly version of the nightfall should always allow F2P, even if its an expansion specific strike.I do have a fair list of criticism I can level at Destiny 2. The list would be exhaustive, and Im quite drunk as I type. So I will instead list my largest and (IMO) most egregious oversight.The in-game communication, social, and matchmaking features are despicably lacking. The everyone can see this \"local\" text channel is OPT-IN, as is the team (Matchmade) one. Accessible through the options menu but still rather hidden.The higher tiers of end-game content are premade group ONLY. Which would be crappy, but acceptable, IF this was a game with proper communication and social features implemented.As it currently stands your best bet to find groups for these activities is through an EXTERNAL source, I.E. Forums, Reddit, the honestly POO-TIER app. etc.Chances are that in rebuttal to these complaints you will hear the eerily familiar arguments made by old-school WoW players (myself included, much to my chagrin.) that it somehow improves the game or makes it better, or that the content is too hard for a matchmade group. These arguments miss the point of QOL versus being Obtuse.Regardless, Destiny is 100% worth your time to try at the price of zero monies. And if you like what you play, then the expansions are, in my own opinion, worth your money.I hope to see a lot more Guardians playing soon!", "Author": "Mr. E Skull", "Hours": 506.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 19, 2020", "Review": "Raids with 5 friends will either be the best experience you have or will make you want to beat your teammates with lead piping.", "Author": "Real Fire", "Hours": 139.7}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: June 4, 2021", "Review": "game sucks devs dont care ", "Author": "kekdoubleyou", "Hours": 512.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 11, 2019", "Review": "\"The Light lives in all places\" O que \u00e9 Destiny 2?

Bem, o jogo funciona mais ou menos assim: Depois de um tutorial bem simples que nos mostra o que est\u00e1 rolando, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel j\u00e1 prosseguir para o multiplayer e fazer diversas coisas, o game tem uma esp\u00e9cie de lobby onde podemos comprar itens na loja de cash, fazer palha\u00e7adas com os amigos (floodar emotes), coletar itens que esquecemos durante as miss\u00f5es e tamb\u00e9m, pegar novas miss\u00f5es e aprimorar os equipamentos.

O game \u00e9 dividido em diferentes \u00e1reas, para cada planeta que voc\u00ea vai, com certeza voc\u00ea vai se deparar com uma barra de loading, enfim, cada \u00e1rea dessas \u00e9 composta por v\u00e1rios inimigos e NPCs que lhe dar\u00e3o miss\u00f5es, recompensas e afins, da para atravessar essas \u00e1reas usando um \"pod\" que \u00e9 um ve\u00edculo no melhor estilo Star Wars.

O game tem um sistema bem simplificado de classes, s\u00e3o apenas tr\u00eas classes, mas, cada classe tem sua fun\u00e7\u00e3o e habilidades pr\u00f3prias, por exemplo: Se voc\u00ea quiser jogar como um Warlock que \u00e9 a classe mais pr\u00f3xima de um suporte na minha opini\u00e3o, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel usar uma de tr\u00eas variantes de builds, cada uma \u00e9 pr\u00f3pria para atacar, evitar dano ou curar.

A customiza\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem \u00e9 bem simplificada, s\u00e3o apenas tr\u00eas ra\u00e7as, mas quando digo que \u00e9 bem simplificada n\u00e3o quero dizer que \u00e9 algo ruim, apesar de n\u00e3o termos tantas escolhas ao menos podemos fazer um personagem muito bem feito.

Getting snappy headshots with revolvers is some of the most satisfying shooting Ive ever experienced.All keys can be remapped, the mouse has raw input, theres an FOV slider, film grain and chromatic aberration toggles. Theres even a suite of colour-blind modes. Pretty much every kind of customization you could want. Sound design is equally impressive, with each of the hundreds of weapons having tons of punchy firing sounds, clicks, whirrz, electric charges, etc. The variety and quality is great.Optimisation on PC is fantastic, easily pushing 100fps+ on my 5 year old PC with a 980 Ti at max settings (1440p). And the art style is absolutely gorgeous. The environments alone will make you stop and stare in awe on your first playthrough.Year after year, the game has improved. Entire gameplay systems and mechanics have been reworked, removed, or replaced entirely, and the experienced keeps getting better. Lots of quality-of-life and streamlining as well as balancing keeps things fresh. With Shadowkeep / New Light, a lot of the UI has been overhauled, and it makes everything so much nicer to navigate - quests, bounties and other useful information are now separated and much easier to find and sort through.The story / campaign alone was quite short, though with 2 years of addons, theres enough here to feel like a complete game. But once the main story ends is when the game really begins. The exotic quests, cooperative Strikes and Menagerie give you tons of replayability, as well as PVP competitive modes to hone your skills against other players. You will always have something new to unlock or progress towards, rewarding you for playing any activities.  As a returning long-time player, I cant really comment on the new story / progression system, though it seems like a bit of a weird start for newcomers, since you get thrown right into the action at a really high experience level, and the first 2 years of story appear to be entirely optional.

The game is impressively consistent in its theme, it can be seen and felt throughout the entirety of the game. The art, visuals, gear, HUD, music and combat all compliment each other and deliver a very consistent and unique mystic space adventure.* Combat (8/10): Very satisfying combat system. Despite its simplicity (3 Weapons + Class Ability A, B & Grenade), the balance between them paired with your Super Ability makes playing matches a very satisfying & challenging experience. The Super itself is a very thrilling mechanic to use (although very short and occasional). However, there are a few mechanics that the game needs to revamp, especially in regards to weapon balance.* Visuals (10/10): The game is absolutely gorgeous. The art style is one of the best Ive seen to date and is consistent across all aspects of the game. The Scenes, characters, textures, visual effects and general outlook are all well designed and in-line with the games theme. Cutscenes are also incredibly well made.  * Music (10/10): Outstanding musical production. The OSTs are some of the most memorable things about Destiny 2. You will be searching them on YouTube after finishing, I guarantee you that.* Characters & Voice Acting (9/10): Despite little dialogue in this game, characters draw you to them pretty fast. They are well written and outstandingly voice acted. You will find yourself strangely attached to characters after your second encounter.The Bad* Story (3/10): To put it simply, There is No Story.The game starts with a pretty good tutorial sequence that introduces the game and many characters. But then it only offers you 3 Story Campaigns that are: 1- Paid: You get to play the first mission of each then the game asks you to pay up.2- Unrelated to each other: Just 3 independent mini stories.3- 5-6 Hours Long: With no final campaign to tie them. They just play out and thats it.[Dont get me wrong, they are excellent and well written, but just not enough]* Missions (5/10): Not much diversity in mission objectives. Its all basically \"go from A to B and kill everyone in your path, then get a box\". Although there is a pretty decent selection of maps, you will end up replaying same exact line of objective (on the same previous paths) throughout most of the game. There is very little variety in the gameplay that Destiny 2 offers besides map diversity.The game has:6 Medium-sized Open World maps.3 Gameplay Modes (Shoot & Loot Missions, Arena ESports, and Deathmatch)3 Quest types (Solo Campaign missions, Co-op Grind Missions and Bounties)- Bounties are just daily challenges. Ex: \"Kill X number of enemies with Y Weapon Type\"* Matchmaking (4/10): Hit and Miss. Sometimes you end up with people close to your level and enjoy. Sometimes with very new players, and end up carrying them (doubling the extent of the match). And many times you will end up with players way above your level who will dash through the map and clear out rooms in seconds, leaving you with absolutely nothing to do. The game is extremely unbalanced and unorganised in this regard. The chaotic match making system has often ruined the game for me.* Replay value (0/10): There is absolutely no reason for you to go back and replay the game. It offers nothing but loot, No StoryLimited FreedomLimited Character CustomisationLiterally the same exact objectives over and over* Progression (5/10): At first, progression will feel very rewarding as you will be going through a lot of loot and cosmetics to further enhance your character to your liking. But after the 15th hour, it will get too repetitive. There is no real sense of reward in this game aside from loot, the absence of a storyline is probably the main factor that made this so prominent. After a while, you will only be grinding for stats and numbers. And due to limited objective types, the game might feel like a chore sometimes, the same you might see in other massive co-ops like Warframe. The Ugly - Chaotic Questline System: Destiny 2 Routine > Get Boring Bounties > Go kill X number of enemies > get back to quest giver > get loot > repeat. You only get to track 3 quests at a time so you have to open your menu often to check for count (doesnt pause game).- Filler Objectives: The game is so limited in content, that it recycles the same objective and delivers it back to you hoping it can fool you into thinking its a new mission type. The game is clearly low on content, and is trying hard to stretch its play hours with recycled missions. - Disparity in Difficulty: You sometimes enter missions where you feel useless, and others where you just clear out rooms in a breeze. The game doesnt help you prepare for what is coming. - Death by Fall Damage: The game can really push your buttons with how articulate in needs you to be in timing and aiming your jumps, you will die A LOT from falling off the map. And some maps might drive you crazy by throwing you into a boss fight on a very narrow platform, with limited visibility and to make things worse, they also give the boss a shockwave ability that throws you off the map.- Missing Tutorials: Too many important mechanics and items are not explained in any sense or form. You will need a Wiki to progress in Destiny 2.* Conclusion: Despite numerous flaws in Destiny 2, it is still good. I have enjoyed the 20 hours I spent on it, but thats all I could give it. Everything becomes way too repetitive after 20-30 hours. Destiny 2 could have been one of the greatest games ever made if they had focused on:- Making a cohesive Story Mode, with at least 6 or 7 Campaigns and an actual Final Sequence & Ending.- Adding unique objectives in Missions, and allowing more locations of the open worlds to be used for missions.- More Weapons, Armour, Cosmetics to be obtained as guaranteed rewards, not randomly generated (and improving RNG & diversity).- Granting the ability to track all quests in a single map at once.- Guiding players better in understanding the games mechanics and properly prepare them for the next step instead of throwing them to run around and get nothing solid done.7/10 ", "Author": "ZeezoRockOut", "Hours": 657.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 19, 2020", "Review": "Paid about 60 euros for destiny 2 when it was a paid gamePaid about 40-60 euros for dlcs (not beyond light)i have spend 100-120 euros for the game, i have 300 hours on the gamei come back to the game now, after a year of not touching it, and realize that half of my favorite content and most of my favorite raids gone, thanks bungeei thought that bungee leaving activision was a good thing, but i dont know what i think nowdo not buy the beyond light, do not give them money, please dislike the game, so we can get our content back, this is ridiculous", "Author": "Meh Duckling\u00ae", "Hours": 314.7}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: January 29, 2020", "Review": "its a good game, but it has a few too many flaws for my tastes.biggest flaw being the fact it randomly resets to be fullscreen. and worst of all this cannot be changed back without logging into the game, loading a character and getting through all the \"look at whats happening now!\" stuff if not the opening cinematics since it your first character. as we cannot have a nice options menu on the character creation screen.thew only other major flaw for me is how much effort needs to be put in towards getting Exotics, the special and often more sought after guns in the game. they often have mechanics that are variants of the stock lesser rarities or are wildly different and sometimes even in different slots than normal. most of these are either pure luck to get them to drop, waiting for a tentacled monster to sell it to you or going through a rough trial to unlock.otherwise, the shooting mechanics are very good, with some nerfing towards ranged weapons like assault rifles, pulse rifles, scout rifles and sniper rifles so you spend more time in close combat and not plinking away at enemies. also explosive weapons dont feel as great with their very limited ammo pools and sometimes feel like im shooting sponges with water pistols.the story elements feel very light and airy in the game and actually a bit contradictory at times as instances like the tower had NPCs talking about the completion of the red war, before i had actually even finished it. otherwise story is mostly just there for the sake of having it with all the old rewards for finishing them being stripped away and i think only the rewards for finishing the most recent DLC, shadowkeep, being still instated. this could have been used to allow players to get some of the older weapons and exotics but nope, stripped off.visuals for the game are fabulous. from the backgrounds to the enemies each looks fabulous. i like how the environments are varied and tackle some rather great looking sets but my biggest dig is the reuse of levels where missions will reuse portions of the overworld map for story missions and quests with varying levels of community interaction. ive had several quests that take me down the same tunnel into the same dark zone but travel slightly different areas within them but still use all the same large rooms.armor is also kinda a whole nother can of worms as well with each piece having stats towards how your character plays BUT, if you find an ugly piece you have to either save up your bright dust and hope you catch an armor ornament when its in the shop, spend a heft of premium currency towards a set (15USD) or nab it from a seasonal quest. i did not run into any quests that rewarded armor ornaments. also, some ornaments are ONLY for exotic armor so thats also something to look out for when buying them off the store.", "Author": "Koz Broke It", "Hours": 124.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 26, 2019", "Review": "I like the guns", "Author": "Super Robbie Wars", "Hours": 590.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 26, 2019", "Review": "The game has many content and good to play with friends but server optimization is sucks.", "Author": "Alphayes", "Hours": 18.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: February 9, 2021", "Review": "Its hot  dogwater, drink up ", "Author": "Suede Jacked Mello", "Hours": 4007.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 12, 2020", "Review": "Pre Beyond Light this game was great it had loads of content both free and paid for everyone to enjoy.

The music, the visuals, the powers, the gear, the maps. All of it is nothing short of what youd expect from someone who was apart of Halo.So why am i not recommending it?Because it has the worst execution on the market. Ive seen people argue for and against developers and whether or not they are involved in the monetization of the games. Often i see them as having this big creative vision and then the publisher kicks in the door with some monetized gimmick that just obliterates anything the base game had going for it.Destiny I had given the benefit of the doubt to because Activision/Blizzard is one of the most awful perpetrators of this practice, but then Bungie and Activision split. So I waited, what new things awaited on the horizon for Destiny now that it was unshackled from its publisher? Whelp, not a damn thing. In fact, they monetized the game harder by wiping old content and forcing you to play newer content so they could make MORE money. I was hoping a return to something like destiny 1 where we just get new planets and raids, but you can still play all the old ones. Make a huge amount of available content that you can looter shooter to your hearts content. Instead, DLC makes the game SMALLER with each update and everything you hated about microtransactions before is well protected and being added on to.Additionally, Bungie decided ages ago 2 concepts for endgame. 1. Lets get rid of any streamlined QoL features for players to group up and join each other, you have to dig though a mountain of third party horse sh*t to apply to guilds who usually require some completely convoluted set of obstacles if you want to consistently raid with people. Every time i download and try this bullsh*t out again I struggle to make friends or add people after the fact, which just results in your quietly grinding through boring BS and if you like another player, tough titties, thats the last you will ever see them.2. Endgame is COMPLETELY reliant on having people to play with. There is no such thing as \"solo farming\" once you start trying to grind out things for the end game. Theres small little things you can do hear and there, but if you want any motes or to do anything relevant. You have to have 5 friends. All 6 of you have to do the objectives every week together to maximize your farm. Oh steve is out sick this week? Bill has work in the morning?

These should really be earned in the game itself especially since some of these game modes do not have cosmetics like some of the older activities in previous yearsThe perk combinations that come with the current seasons guns are...middling to say the least. While I respect the design philosophy that Bungie is making to avoid creating more \"god roll\" weapons, its sadly a trench theyve already dug themselves with the current meta of the game, and thus its really something they shouldnt pursue in Destiny 2 at all along with their aforementioned retiring of older legendary items (likely to help push forward this design choice)Ultimately, the seasonal model is mostly copypasta elements of previous seasons or past year activities - very minimal effort on their parts with the only seemingly \"new\" addition this season being Trials of Osiris, which in of itself is a copypasta from Destiny 1 mostlySadly, this might be the first season I will not purchase especially since the big elements (iron banner, trials of osiris) are effectively f2p and honestly I dont see a very bright future for Season 11 if Bungie keeps up the current trend. Trials of Osiris is really the only thing thats keeping the playerbase actively engaged this season.

Bungie deciding to sunset half of the gear that I used when I last played, and shutting down half of the content that I was familiar with makes this a dumpster fire. Who (in their right mind) pays $50 so that the devs can take away content?Narrative backstoryI started playing on Bnet only because it was free. The base game, then, was thin and difficult to get into only because all the players were doing the latest content and their power level was so far above mine that nothing that was accessible to me was fun or something that older players would do. New Light fixes this. I got Curse of Osiris & Warmind free on bnet (because they didnt advertising giving them to all bnet players, but they did.) So I reinstalled, discovered this and went ahead and got hooked on raiding and Gambit. I invested in Forsaken and consider it the best story expansion for D2 to-date. I managed to get a couple of triumphs away from the MMXIX seal (Season of Opulence.) But I was about 2 weeks away when the season ended. I purchased Shadowkeep and Season of the Undying and Ive been enjoying the game since.ProsHealthy raiding, PVE and PVP communities.Wealth of story. Moderately deep lore.Available on steam.Seasonal content.Weekly rotations on existing content to keep it fresh.Lots of achievements (aka Triumphs)Lots of flexibility in classes.ConsThere are a number of imbalances that remain unfixed.There are a number of game breaking bugs the devs ignore. (They are few, but they exist.)A lot of Pay2Win content. (They just released a $1 per level catchup mechanic hidden behind in-game currency. There are 100 season levels, which means in addition to the $15 season, players are incentivized to drop up to $100 extra on leveling up their season rank for time limited rewards. Additionally, those rewards include boosts and gear that will improve your performance in game.Despite lots of fanbois claiming that things are better than when Bungie was under Activision, if you compare the shenanigans from pre-Steam and post-Activision theyre largely the same. (Ive not had a single enthusiast disagree with me yet.)Shadowkeep was very thin, as delivered. On par with Curse of Osiris (which was the first and objectionably the thinnest expansion D2 has seen to-date.) Shadowkeep beats Osiris by virtue of the addition of a dungeon and a raid. So while the story content isnt very consuming, there is plenty of meat on these bones.Some of the achievements are RNG based. And RNG based achievements are cancer.Same for special raid/event drops. I think we learned these lessons in MMOs 10 years ago and revamped the whole reward system so that if you were unlucky, you still at least got something that would help you eventually purchase a desired piece of gear rather than being the 1% who something simply never drops for.Time limited triumphs are also RNG dependent (because they can be dependent on whether an item drops.)New Light is poorly delivered. While the new content is great, and giving people the ability to participate in all free content at a power level that is competitive with paying customers is an awesome idea for bringing in new blood-- the accessibility of Destiny via New Light is poor. Ive had dozens of my friends try and then quit the game because the learning curve was too steep and the introduction was being dumped into the deep end without swimming lessons.Destiny on Steam has a lot of integration issues. It wasnt designed for Steam and the two regularly break down (Which can actually prevent you from playing on D2 even though others are online and the game servers are up.)TL;DR;While Destiny has a lot going for it, it is not without its scuffs and flaws. Im not invested in the community enough to know just how serious Bungie is about fixing those flaws (beyond what is absolutely necessary to continue bringing in paying customers.)I do think that there are much needed fixes and improvements to smooth out the rough edges. They also really need to rework every bit of the social component of Destiny. While I do like the integration with Steam friends, having the in-game chat servers go down when Steam friends goes down seems like a terrible single point of failure in their current design.Likewise, the game needs a better matchmaking/LFG system. The community has created a solution, but its a patch on the fact that Bungie offers virtually nothing.VerdictTry it out with a friend to help guide you.Take some time to learn the game economy before you spend real money.", "Author": "Mazian", "Hours": 1093.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 14, 2019", "Review": "There is not a game that has brought my main game more than Destiny.

The character creator is horrible. You cant rotate to see your character from different angles so you make sure you like how he looks, granted that you cant change your appearance afterwards (this is so stupid Bungie :D).2. The new begining is still very boring. I appreciate the fact that it has a shorter exposition.3. The shooting is unsatisfying, which most of the players seem to praise for some reason. The guns are nice, but I think the enemies are unfun to shoot at, because they dont react to bullets.4. Enemy AI is just plain bad. There also seem to be weird spawns out of thin air.5. Quests give you no motivation to finish them. Mostly is just running through empty corridors, shooting fodder enemies, then loot some chest.6. The story is lazy. I always fought the urge not to skip the dialogue.7. The skills are fun, but lack depth. Its kinda lame that you dont get to see the cooldowns in seconds.8.

I made the blind jump with them from Halo CE to Halo 2, until eventually Reach was their final farewell. I didnt want to say goodbye, so I followed them blindly once again with their next adventure, Destiny.Intro:Ill try to skip right to the point, but first of all its important to understand the difference between \"fanboy\" and \"dedicated player\" when it comes to this franchise. I LOVE STORY. Its my foremost drive when it comes to playing a game start to finish. If you cant reel me in? Then Im probably gonna put you back on the shelf. Destiny started off with mystery, wonder, excitement, exploration. And then... max level happened. Not until The Taken King did I really find my interest again in learning about the world Bungie was building from a story and even gameplay perspective.Gameplay: 4/5Destiny 2 has a very simple premise, heres a gun, heres some abilities (one of three classes and eventually 3 specs), kill stuff. With the release of Forsaken and Shadowkeep, theyve kept it fresh with changes welcomed in the first game and new to the second. If youre looking for a superhero action game with co-op and plenty of explosions (and death, lets be real) Destiny 2 is your home.Story: 4/5Now I know I started off by saying story is my foremost important factor when it comes to a game. Destiny hasnt... always told it well. In the first game, you were given crumbs, and if you did manage to unlock story content, it was text you could only read on their website, taking you completely away from the game itself. Trailing back to Halo, it started off with wonderment and excitement and then eventually they revealed more content over the years but now 343i has made it almost EXCLUSIVELY about the extra content; books, comics, etc.Bungie fixed this in Destiny 2 by making their story content available IN-GAME. They made a brilliant choice and the story has been compelling (given some hiccups) since Day 1. Forsaken and Shadowkeep are further points towards making it clear that Bungie isnt done telling the stories that the players want.Co-op: 5/5I have nothing bad to say about co-op aside from the 3 player limit for most content. But with Crucible allowing 4 players and raids allowing 6, its vast enough to have a small intimate team of players working together towards a common goal: LOOT! Ive always had a blast playing Destiny with friends, and that doesnt stop even after the last few years.Final Score/Note: 4/5This isnt the most traditional review. Im not even 100% sure why Im writing this. But I hope through all the clutter of voices, this one can maybe be heard and resonate with someone. Do you love story? Do you love shooting things? Do you love doing this with a handful of close friends or aquaintances? PLAY. THIS. GAME. Destiny 2 awaits, Guardian.P.S.

I am utterly disappointed with the business practices which Bungie has developed, which border on theft of service as well as being overly greed-driven and quite frankly not giving a product which comparable in value to the dollar amount charged.  Its a truly great disappointment in where this company and this franchise has gone.  The gaming community deserves better.With as much as your expansions cost, with the way you disable content which was ALREADY paid for when new expansions come out, with all the microtransactions, and the pay-to-win mechanics.....you should at the VERY LEAST make the licenses cross platform compatible and your new DLCs contain the old content as well.Its absolutely ridiculous want even MORE profit off it after all youre already making and the way youre flirting the line with theft of service (which is a form of fraud) to begin with.  That is just corporate greed and a very good way to not only end up in legal trouble when you do cross the line, but lose your player base....which you already have been.  In summation, short term gains but long term catastrophic losses.That said, mechanically and visually the game is very pleasing, and the pick up and go flexibility is nice...yet you should extend the matchmaking for activities more than it currently exists.  But your business practices do not seem to reflect a desire to maintain a player base or a continuity structure in what was originally formulated as an FPSMMO.In fact, it seems as though you, Bungie, as a company have taken far too many lessons from Activisions playbook and are becoming a disappointment to the gaming community.  Activision ruins perfectly good games and franchises for sake of squeezing every dollar out that they can.  Thats exactly what youre perpetuating as a company even after getting off the teet.Its a real letdown, because I was hoping for something far better out of Bungie after the way Destinys first incarnation was botched and butchered so horribly.  Yet even the first Destiny was not perverted for profit this far and it still had BETTER raid mechanics that actually felt like an MMO.  You also continued the SAME mistake from the first Destiny where you severely limited the ability to explore zones by putting so many kill boxes in.In short,  youve utterly trashed what SHOULD have been a truly amazing franchise and it is extremely disappointing.  I will not spend another dime on this franchise blindly hoping that you will fix your issues or take your player base seriously until I see ACTUAL CHANGE.  And dont even get me started on the constant \"re-balancing\".....aka nerfing for the sake of some kid who wines and wines and wines about the strength of a weapon which ended his killstreak while he is lag glitching and cheating in crucible.Maybe you should spend more time paying attention to your player base and less time to squeezing out an increasingly wider profit margin.", "Author": "FatalPleasure", "Hours": 64.4}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 10, 2020", "Review": "Nah", "Author": "Fanta", "Hours": 751.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 4, 2019", "Review": "A okay!", "Author": "Tomthewear", "Hours": 606.0}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 13, 2021", "Review": "Literally the smoothest, best feeling FPS gameplay ive ever played...

If you do have the time and are ok with spending some money (generally comes out to $10 a season pass which lasts 70-80 days and $70 a DLC which has a pattern of coming out each September) then by all means go for it, just try the free to play stuff first.The games main focus is PvE, pitting you in strikes, nightfalls (harder strikes, better loot) and Raids (big ol 6 people versus big bad) to get your loot and space hero fix. PvE gets updated the most so if you like that, youre in for a treat. PvP is secondary in this game but still very fun, so long as you have some decent guns and know how FPS works. Sadly, PvP isnt updated or really taken care of at all by Bungie so things that go wrong in there tend to stay a while. Currently Stasis is the mainstay and kinda busted, but not unbeatable. It needs a few tweaks but as Destiny is a mainly PvE game, itll probably be a bit. Try PvP second and make sure you do it with friends.At the time of writing this Ive sunken a good 845 hours into it.

A title suitable for that which turns worlds upside down. When I was still uninitiated, I would stand guard at my post. I would look to the sky and see the two suns of my Lubrae: one eternally shaded in the dark, the other always a brilliant blue. And in them, I had seen the folly of our kind. A fear of something we believed bigger than us... and a reliance on that which kept us. That blue sun that we harnessed our power from... a simple reversal of that power cracked the blue in half. Shut it off. And Lubrae... died. I did not know it at the time, but it was necessary. And now that Savath\u00fbn has trapped me within these walls, it will be necessary again. My Witness... whether I survive Savath\u00fbns betrayal or not, the Upended will ensure we salvage our perfect goal. The final abyss... awaits us all. \"Conqueror,\" many called me. Again and again, I heard this word. Lobbed my direction not with admiration, but with malice. \"Not a conqueror,\" I would respond. \"What, then?\" they would ask. I do not tell them, my Witness. As you so graciously taught me, I show them. Just as I did in the unholy den of those starving \"worm gods.\" Ill not forget the stench of their rotting flesh... or the way they cowered as I drew near. But they soon learned I was not to be feared. In the end, I left them only a promise of sustenance, and in return, they became chattel for our greater purpose: absolute finality. And as I walked away, their fountainhead in tow, I could hear them whisper with respect: \"Subjugator.\" It was your infinite wisdom, my Witness, that led me into the planets great sea... and face to face with that which was believed to be unbeatable. You instilled in me a true understanding of wanton domination. Not for pleasure, but as a means to achieve our absolute finality. When I reached the creature known to some as the Leviathan, it laid its thoughts bare. \"Turn from the deep, fearmonger,\" it relayed. \"I know what you seek. Press on, and you will drown in it.\" \"I do not drown,\" I spoke with a defiant tongue. In a mere infinitesimal measure of time, I held a rib of this beast in one hand and pushed aside its maimed vessel with the other. \"I rise.\" Puppets, all of them. Every last Krill. Every last Hive. I once believed in a higher calling as they do. But you know that. You rescued me from that. Eternal appreciation doesnt even scratch the surface of what I owe you for the gifts you gave me. I know you hoped the Krill would see it too. We tried. We really did. But we had to let them struggle... All because of a belief that purpose had finally found them. Given them strength to conquer an oppressive homeworld. How else were they to grow? Their loss, however, is for them to grieve, not us. We will continue forward. Greater purpose awaits, my Witness. When I stood on that precipice, watching the only world I knew collapse under its own weight... I was prepared for the splendor of abyssal eternity. But you brought me forth, my Witness. Freed me from the world that imprisoned me. Made me see the ultimate truth, one I could never see alone... That on my planet Lubrae, who I was, where I was, what I believed mattered - all amounted to absolute insignificance. I keep this mural not as some worthless sentimental reminder of what I lost, but of the opposite - of what I gained. Power. Truth of the inconsequence of most.

It is not just a FPS game, but MMORPG as well. I thought Destiny 2 is a single player game but I was wrong. So, let me summarize positive side and negative side of this game. What do I like:- Some of campaigns stories are very lengthy and interesting, especially Red War and Forsaken. Also, I do enjoy to watch cinematic cutscene a lot, it really looks like a movie.- There has been so many activities and quests to do (raid, strike, nightfall strike, exotic quests, dungeon, nightmare hunt, public event, escalation and much more). Some of them are lengthy and challenging. For example, legend and heroic nightfall strike is really tough but still I enjoy it a lot. However, you must plan carefully about the equipment you used before start to play nightfall. - Playing D2 together with your friends is really fun. If you are being stuck with some quests, just find your friends to overcome it together. - If you want to have a lot of fun, then just buy all DLCs.- The campaign story is replayable, it is available in Vanguard. What do I dislike?- Always encounter some error codes like beaver, bee, weasels etc when playing crucible and gambit. I really frustrate about such networking issue but dont know what to do with it.  - If I can remember well. There is one of Shadowkeep strikes still currently unplayable. No enemies are around at the beginning and I even cant access to next checkpoint. Sometime I also have encountered some bug when playing Vanguard strike. For example, when playing Scarlet Keep strike, I was spawned randomly at somewhere which is far away from outside of Hive fortress and cant go inside it. It is ridiculous.On the other hand, using some 3rd party softwares or tools like FRAPS, MSI Afterburner, Reshade etc to SLIGHTLY modify the game will get yourself banned even if they arent cheating tools. Dont even try it if you attempt to do so. If doing so, you will be issued account ban or device ban. Bungie is SUPER HARDCORE on these stuffs. Some players have been banned because of it.

Ive heard about its ups and downs.  Similar to other games, Ive also heard it \"redeemed\" itself was in a great state.  Friends of mine were playing it and picked it up again because of the expansion.  Having never played a Destiny game before, intrigued about its rich story, lauded gun play and knew the base game was free, I figured Id give it a try.I have to say that the was this game was presented to a new player was absolutely trash.  Nearly no explanation for anything and the campaign was gutted and along with it, the story. Youre dropped in, given little to no information about anything.  Who are these people?  Why am I fighting them?  Who am I in this story?  What do these stats mean?  What does this currency do?  What happened here?  Why is a game almost 5 years old, a sequel from a game even 3 years older like this?  They cut the thing that gives new players a path to invest in the story and characters???  I wanted to like the game.  The game feels like a combo of The Division and Warframe, but they also kept the explanations of Warframe (I have heard it got a little better) which is atrocious also.The story feels as if you took a large novel, tore out large chunks of the beginning, then 2/3s of the remaining chapters but have them available as DLCs, then continue to sell you additional chapters to add on the end of the novel but also not guaranteeing that the story you already own will be available later.On a side note, there is a 4 hour YouTube video of the story up to Shadowkeep DLC if youre interested.Save your frustrations on another game.  Unless Bungie reverse their decisions and add it all back in, they will destroy any chances of accruing new players in any meaningful way.

Some people have this problem so I mentioned it.To understand in easy words, NAT (Network Address Translation) is a feature of a router to translate a public IP address to a private IP address and vice versa. So, that your network will be secure from outside world. There are 3 types of NAT:-1. Open NAT2.Moderate NAT3. Strict NATOpen NAT is best for online gaming experience where 2 or more players communicate directly(P2P: Peer-2-Peer) without any Data Centres which are normally given by many game companies.In moderate, there are some limits which create problem communicating with friends during the game session.In Strict NAT, you cant able to join with friends.There are some solution to this:-1. Make sure UPnP enabled in your router setting.2. Always allow inbound and outbound rules of Destiny 2 through Firewall.3. If both above dont work then you need to Port Forwarding in your router. You will get TCP and UDP ports from the official site of Bungie or just Google \"Destiny 2 TCP/UDP ports\". If you dont know How to Port Forwarding, there are lots of tutorials online or you can call your ISP Network Engineer for port forwarding.Its now Free To Play on Steam, so why dont you give it a try.

For the franchises entire lifespan, the game has been cursed with lack of content, game-breaking bugs, and issues ranging from mechanics to the corporate level. This is expectation at this point. Usually in the beginning with new releases, the game fails on many levels to meet expectations apart from graphics, music, and deeply interesting lore. The game is carried by its story value alone. The gunplay is very satisfying, but the gameplay is grindy and repetitive. Sometimes, rarely, Bungie really gets it right or fixes their mistakes, making an experience youll want to replay, with unique missions that provide refreshing content and awesome loot, but as of late, Bungies game gets worse and worse as it move further away from its best moments and eventually bins them. Even in D2s best DLCs there have existed exploits that take weeks to fix, with horribly balanced classes and weapons. The progression system is unrewarding. The PvP modes offer more progress than the PvE, with most quests revolving around PvP at some point or entirely. The original story has become so obsolete that Bungie made it optional in Shadowkeep, then deleted it and 70% of the content in Beyond Light. Forsaken and Shadowkeep, which are still paid DLCs, were stripped of their content and now all gear is locked with an impending level cap. All previous exotics are now obtainable only through purchase with special in-game currencies, meaning new players will find themselves lacking in effectiveness during the end-game raids and older players will have to say goodbye to their hours spent getting their gear. It also doesnt help that because of the removed content, new players will have no idea what is going on in the story. Hell, the repeatable missions from the first year of the game still exist, with characters that are now dead, and context that is long passed its expiration date. What Bungie chooses to focus on, keep and remove, is utterly baffling. Instead of overhauling aspects of the game, they bring back content from Destiny 1. They still use the original models for the adversaries, and the variety of armor they include is limited and horrible-looking. A personal pet peeve of mine is they added a cookie cutter Tutorial NPC. It looks impossible for new players to enjoy the game, with no real direction for them to take. Playing with friends at least gives you a better experience, but if you dont have enough you risk playing with toxic randoms. From the perspective of a long-time casual player, I simply feel discouraged to continue as fervently as I used to. I still intend to play, because Ive already played it for so long. Seeing as the current season is mediocre and Bungie still has yet to fix their biggest issues, Destiny 2 is not worth buying at this time; Not for new or returning players.

Its got some of the best lore, art style, gunplay, and music of any game Ive ever played. Yet theres so many things that could be changed or outright removed and I find myself straying away from this game. Whats good:-The new Stasis subclasses (all of the supers are extremely fun in my opinion and each has unique abilities)-Graphics and sound design-Music (and I mean the music is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 amazing)-Art style and scenery-Gunplay (the shooting is very satisfying)-Lore (The lore isnt obvious throughout the game, but there is a lot of outstanding and interesting lorebooks to read about)-Season of the Hunt has brand new weapons and a way to farm god roll versions of each weapon-The new raid, Deep Stone Crypt, is one of the most fun and interesting raids Ive ever played in D2. Its not the hardest by a long shot but its aesthetic, mechanics, and encounters are very good. All in all a great raid.-The rerelease of Prophecy as a pinnacle activity (This rerelease is a good thing because Prophecy was introduced last season)-The new activities on Europa (Empire Hunts, Exo Challenges, Sabotages)-The Destiny LFG community is very friendly. Ive sherpad and been sherpad before and most people are very patient and kind-The introduction of Nightfall-styled high-difficulty lost sectors. Not only that but theres also a bonus for doing these lost sectors solo.-The PvP weapon sandbox in my opinion is more balanced compared to last seasons sandbox.-The introduction of kiosks where new/returning players can buy previous pinnacles and exotics that are no longer obtainable using in-game currencies (no microtransactions).Whats bad:-The game is pretty much worthless without buying the new expansion, Beyond Light-The new Stasis subclasses in Crucible (although theyre very fun to play, they are a nightmare in pvp due to the freezing capabilities. No one likes getting frozen because it prevents retaliation.)-Sunsetting (Say you get a gun you really like and youve farmed the perfect roll for weeks. Well, too bad, it has a capped power level that will make the gun obsolete in 1-2 seasons. Now your hard work is thrown out the window and theres little incentive to farm god roll weapons)-The fact that Black Armory weapons and gear are sunset even though the Last Wish raid weapons arent, which were released before Black Armory came out (That doesnt mean I want the raid weapons sunset too. I want the Black Armory gear unsunset)-The Moon is the location from the previous DLC. Yet all of the gear, except raid gear, on the moon is sunset. This means that every activity (minus the Garden of Salvation raid) is worthless because the gear isnt worth getting. THIS IS LITERALLY CONTENT FROM LAST DLC AND THEY MADE 90% OF THE LOCATION WORTHLESS. The only purpose the moon serves is the Raid.-The Dreaming City and the Tangled Shore also suffer from the same points I made about the Moon. Except, the Dreaming City and Tangled Shore are now used for Wrathborn Hunts, the Seasonal activity. Other than that and the Last Wish Raid, these locations are also pretty worthless. -The lack of new loot in Beyond Light after the removal of half the game-The constant rereleasing of old weapons (Not only are some rereleased weapons the EXACT SAME just with a higher power cap, but the fact that Im getting \"new\" weapons that are the same weapons Ive been using for years is just plain \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665)-The Season of the Hunt activity requires you to play the three playlist modes in order to progress (Strikes, Gambit, Crucible). However, theres nothing interesting about playing these playlist modes when they feel the exact same as they did in YEAR 1. All for an activity that takes 10-40 seconds to start and 7 seconds to kill the boss. For example: Crucible got 0 new maps to replace the 11 vaulted ones, Strikes got 2 new strikes (The Glassway which is pretty good and The Disgraced which is from Destiny 1) to replace the 7 or so vaulted strikes, and Gambit got 0 new maps to replace the 2 vaulted ones.-The new raid, Deep Stone Crypt, only has one difficulty level; its locked at 1220 light recommended. This makes the raid feel less like endgame content and more like gearing up for the nonexistant endgame that Destiny 2 offers. This is because once you finish the raid the first time, each attempt after never gets harder. Then you get to a point where youre so overpowered that the raid is a joke and doesnt feel like endgame content. Since youre so overpowered and the difficulty never gets harder, you start completing raid runs like its nothing and after a short amount of time, you have everything the raid has to offer. Not only that, once you get all of the gear the raid has to offer, then what is the point of playing the raid other then to look at the stunning architecture. That isnt a great incentive for a looter-shooter game that is in serious need of LOOT. Simply adding difficulty levels to the raid would make myself and others want to attempt the raid again.-No Europa-themed maps in Crucible or Gambit-The removal of all the Leviathan raids/raid lairs (Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, Spire of Stars, Crown of Sorrow)-The removal of the Tribute Hall-The removal of the Menagerie (One of the best activities in the game)-The removal of the Scourge of the Past raid-The constant bugs and map glitches that seem to be a norm at this point-Hackers/Cheaters are still an issue in PvP and PvE-The nerfed Bright Dust drop amount-No option to auto-dismantle leveling gear when youre at power cap (This isnt really a big issue, its just something I would like added)-The shader system is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 (The shaders have to be bought with glimmer and legendary shards even though the amount they cost per shader is barely anything. This just adds unnecessary time wasted on pulling shaders out one at a time. The fact that shaders even have an inventory is stupid because they cost nothing. Also, the inventory gets constantly filled with garbage blue and green shaders that most people have no interest in. This means you have to dismantle these garbage shaders 1 or 5 at a time in order to free up space for the shaders you actually want. Not only that, but theres no option to apply a shader to all of your weapons/armor even if you have enough copies of that shader in your inventory. You have to manually 1 by 1 go through each gear piece you want to change the color for and apply it.-Shaders cant be applied to exotic weapons, but can be applied to exotic armor-There is no way to inspect what a full set of armor looks like from the Collections tab. The only armor sets that have a full body view are the ones in Eververse (Microtransaction store).-Most NPC voicelines in the tower have not been updated since the launch of the game.-Although I listed the kiosks as a good thing, my only issue is that weapons like Not Forgotten and Lunas Howl are really easy to afford even though they were previously some of the grindiest pinnacle achievements of crucible players. Its kind of a slap in the face that a new player can just buy a gun that you spent hours grinding up to 5500 Glory for. The guns are sunset though so they are only usable in quick play and survival modes in Crucible.

Can I just get a refund on the $60+ i paid for the game + season pass or w/e it was back then just so i can forget all about this game? Or better yet, give me the content I paid for back?Original review:Mini rant. I have to get this off my mind, I dont care who reads this, I just need this off my mind.Im conflicted as hell. I bought Destiny 2 on BNet at launch, played a couple missions, then I stopped because I got busy with school.Fast forward to the Steam migration, I migrate my character and everythings all good.Today, I decide \"Hey I got some time now and I wana actually finish this campaign!\". I install the game, log in, get cut scenes thrown at me, some motivating speech in a cool black and white style, and some 4 armed dude holding a box and Im suddenly on this icy planet not knowing whats going on. I run to the objective marker, find enemies whos level is ?? shoot them, theyre immune to damage, then get shot by them and die instantly. Ok so I try again maybe this is a sneaking mission, NOPE die again. I decide \"eh maybe they expected my character to be ready for this ill come back later after beating the main story.\"I then realize something was off. Last time I played, there was no tower as it was being attacked, and the Traveler was captured by some big alien dudes and you lost your abilities and you were in this cool looking shanty town in a mountain forest with a big piece of the traveler out in the distance you had to go to. So I go to the Tower, get confused, walk around, talk to people and get confused. I look online, learn Im supposed to go to the Cosmodrome from Destiny 1, ok cool I do that. Run through first part, find enemies, get stomped becuase Im not sure what the hell at that point. So I do some research, the original D2 campaign \"The Red War\" has been \"vaulted\" for basically \"game is getting to big lets simplify it\". OK so what the heck am I supposed to do? Well apparently I do some basic PVE, PVP, one of the later campaigns thats apparently available for free to play players, and call it there because I guess im a free to play player now considering I have none of the previous expansions.So my character I made at launch is woefully underpowered, and I have no idea what the hell Im supposed to do. I want to play the original campaign of D2 so I can come to grips on what is going on with the story and gameplay. I played D1 on PS4 years ago, enjoyed it and its convoluted story. I want to play D2s story and continue it.Honestly, I feel cheated. Yes I bought the game at launch, barely touched it. People would say \"Oh well the game is a live service! the game is always changing, its your fault for missing out on the things years ago.\" Ok fine I guess, it is my fault for missing out and I accept that no problem. I wasnt expecting everything to be there when I were to hop back in years later. But seeing the story gone, and the game giving me no direction on what to do right now as an old player who barely touched the original campaign who wants to go back and finish it, Im not sure what to do at this point.Wouldnt it be great if it was an option to have an option to access this content instead of just removing it outright? Bungie can say the game is too big and a mess to maintain but Im not sure about that. Just hide it out of the way, yes its \"legacy\" content at this point, fine. But I saw a terminal in the tower for legacy quests and stuff. Imagine just putting the campaign there for players who want to go back to it. The planets for the campaign missions have been removed? Oh well why not keep the bare minimum of data needed just for those missions? Add simple matchmaking for those missions for co-op as an option, or maybe even tweak the missions to be solo only. I dont really care at that point. Give players the option to want to go and do the old stuff, especially the new players who would love to know what the hell is going on in this universe instead of being expected to read a wiki on things happening. It feels like a \"I do not know who I am, I dont know why Im here, All I know is that I mist kill\" because I have no idea what Im supposed to do.I wish steam had a \"middle\" option, like Yeah I recommend this game, it plays good and I would recommend getting into it. But me whos now turned off by D2 becuase I cant access the old content I paid for, or isnt given a proper guiding hand on what Im supposed to do. Im not sure I can reccomend it.Maybe for new players who dont care, yeah go play the game, enjoy the F2P goodness, maybe buy the new expansions and play those. But for me, I might just skip them all together. Maybe I might come back and make a new character and start there, but Im not sure atm. I cant justify paying the amount of money needed to even just play a campaign, which I guess I would need to play \"Shadowkeep\" first. But Im not sure.I dont want to give it a thumbs down, but imagine it as a \"thumbs down + asterisk\" with the asterisk being that this is actually a good game, just content is removed and behind paywalls.

Best case scenario would be if you have a friend that has already played this game for a while to guide you in the beginning, because if you have no experience in this game and in general not so much MMO experience, you will be overwhelmed at first by Destiny 2. But all that aside, Destiny 2 is an amazing experience. Youre going to have tons of quests for storylines or weapons, missions you can run in fireteams of 3 (if you dont have people you can also solo queue and will be paired with 2 randoms) that are fairly easy, really challenging raids and missions with high difficulty but high reward in a weekly rotation, tons and tons of different weapons with a lot of unique ones, a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge lore (Id recommend \"My Name Is Byf\" on YouTube, he does exceptional videos on Destiny Lore), you will definitely feel really powerful, the game is beautiful (seriously, absolutely gorgeous and it doesnt even require powerful specs), there are a ton of activities to do in social locations aswell as tons of secrets to discover (most even with a reward in form of either a quest for an exotic weapon or really good loot).Unfortunately Destiny also does a few things wrong. PVP is completely unbalanced, because although there is no Level-advantage, people that have played longer and thus acquired some pretty nasty weapons will have a clear advantage. Additionally, this season a new focus-element \"Stasis\" dropped (the focus is the element youll have your abilities and your Super in). Stasis is only available who bought the new DLC and played through its campaign and it is a completely overpowered PVP focus, since you can easily freeze enemies and not only will they have to mash a button to break free, theyll also get a lot of damage from breaking free. This PVP-unbalance isnt unique to this new DLC unfortunately, it has always been a problem that some or several weapon/-s will trump any encounter. Destinys weakness isnt only in PVP though. There are some strikes that are simply no fun but there are still being kept in the playlist. The game is very unforgiving towards new players since there isnt a real tutorial (this is especially bad with this new DLC since campaigns and raids from earlier in the game that were great beginner content were taken out of the game, so if youre thinking about starting with Destiny then make sure you have someone that can guide you through the mechanics of the game). Quests to acquire or upgrade an exotic weapon are very grindy (this shouldnt be too much of a problem since those quests are more intended to be played passively, but for some weapons youll have to kill insane amounts of enemies for that quest that youll probably forget about it if you dont actively grind for it).", "Author": "TerraNova", "Hours": 539.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 15, 2020", "Review": "Anyone getting stuttering after beyond light launched and didnt have it before, try disabling Nvidia Reflex  Help Article here!

The world of Destiny is meticulously crafted by its loving developer, and theres usually always something to do when you boot it up whether that be completing that quest you never finished or reading that lore book you thought was interesting. Not to mention the numerous updates that add hot and fresh content for players to guzzle down their throats like an old lady guzzles warm milk to fall asleep.

Service implies  consistency and a smooth user experience. Service tries to hide the limitations of the team delivering it. Destiny 2 is something else. Destiny 2 is games-as-an-infrastructure\u2014a subway system that gradually builds into something bigger and more sprawling; that needs to be constantly maintained; that will sometimes keep you waiting because such projects are big and complicated and the people running them cant do everything at once.With Shadowkeep, Bungie is redrawing the map. The expansion adds a revitalised tourist destination\u2014the Moon, returning from the first Destiny with a handful of new attractions and a fresh coat of paint\u2014but also spearheads a more fundamental shift in purpose. A series of small tweaks and changes that add up to something that feels at once far-reaching and, paradoxically, not as dramatic as it first seems.Players return to the Moon in search of series regular Eris Morn, the Destiny character voted most likely to keep a LiveJournal. Shadowkeeps campaign manages to highlight both the best and worst of Bungies storytelling. The specific objectives are tiresomely monologued by Eris before you head out; the mystical technobabble ensuring I rarely ever know what Im actually doing. The broad strokes are that you need to forge a new, special armour set, but the delivery is rendered obtuse thanks to the density of arcane Hive rituals and mystical macguffins.And yet! On a wider level its a triumph, thanks to an overarching threat that feels grand in both its menace and in the way Bungie has seeded it throughout the last two years of the game. As someone whos read my fair share of Destiny lore collectibles, coming face to face with the thing that hides beneath the Moon felt dramatic and shocking. Oh \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, I have to deal with one of those? I felt unprepared, which speaks to how successfully Bungie has teased the Destiny universes larger antagonist.As a collection of missions, Shadowkeeps campaign is largely business as usual. Youll fight your way to an arena and kill a big ogre. Youll fight your way to an arena and kill a big Captain. Youll fight your way to an arena and kill a big Wizard and then run away very fast. There isnt the same thematic playfulness as, say, Forsakens campaign, which used the skillset of each Baron as the basis for how youd beat them. Instead, Shadowkeep works in part because of the reason Destiny always works\u2014it feels good to shoot the guns\u2014but also because, as an environment, the Moon is dripping with atmosphere and nostalgia.The Moon has always been one of Destinys most evocative locations, but the new areas in Shadowkeep\u2014the Scarlet Keep in particular\u2014are astonishing in their beauty. The red tower looks almost like a painting, looming dark and ominous in the distance. As for the returning parts of the map, Bungie deftly avoids the disappointment that can come from retreading old ground. It helps that this is the Moons first appearance on PC, but\u2014even for people like me, who spent hours farming Helium Filaments in the first game\u2014Bungie has shown enough restraint when it comes to resurrecting old content that here the return feels novel and exciting.I get a kick out of revisiting destinations like the Traitor\u2019s Ketch, where Taniks once challenged players in the ways of old, or from navigating the tunnels under the surface using nothing but memory and guesswork. Most of Shadowkeeps guns are tied to quests that require tracking down trinkets throughout the world. While many will likely turn to Google, Ive enjoyed getting lost underground, refamiliarising myself with the strange sights of the Hives stronghold. It helps that, even for the returning locations, enough has been subtly changed that it feels like time has passed\u2014a rare thing in a game thats largely about doing the same things over and over.The campaigns ending may be abrupt, but, as always, the expansions story is more of a tease of things to come\u2014some of it through the next year of seasonal releases, the rest likely further out still. In the meantime, the familiar and steady rhythm of Destiny 2 resumes after players have hit the relatively easy-to-reach soft power cap of 900. The slower journey to the hard cap of 950 may have been remixed, but the notes are largely the same\u2014relying on the weekly drops of powerful gear from three-player Strike missions, Crucible PvP matches, the still-brilliant competitive PvE of Gambit, and the new raid, which challenges players with a series of puzzle-like encounters among the vibrant, Vex-infested greenery of the Black Garden.Theres a renewed focus on bounties now, with each vendor offering a powerful reward if you complete a set number within a week. Thanks to the XP awards now granted by bounties, which award progress along a season pass full of goodies as well as powering up the new seasonal artefact, the steady tick of treats keeps things moving at a nice pace. That said, Id love a central bounty board that collected them all up for easy access. Nothing delays a fireteam like having to bounce between vendors hoovering up bounties for every activity that might be on the cards for that evening.As for specifics additions and changes, yes, theres a new Nightfall variant\u2014The Ordeal, which has curated modifiers that increase in number as you up the difficulty. Yes, the Crucible playlists have been retooled, giving players more control over what mode they play, (and letting you earn Glory score without ever having to suffer through a round of Countdown). And yes, there are new Strikes and a couple of Crucible maps from the first game that make their PC debut. But theres also a lot of repeating the same things that weve been doing for over a year. You will run the Pyramidion strike and earn a Ten Paces. You will play a Control match on Vostok and be rewarded with a Does Not Compute.The lack of new world or vendor loot isnt a surprise\u2014if Destiny 2 game director Luke Smiths essay on the state of the game pre-Shadowkeep had a single throughline, it was the limitations of what a development team can reasonably produce. Nevertheless, I was surprised how much being awarded the same old guns hurt my excitement for the year ahead. Ah \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, here we go again: another year of dismantling Go Figure.That isnt to say there arent new guns. Both Shadowkeep and the Vex Offensive activity that headlines the Season of the Undying (which runs in parallel to the expansions release), each have their own new weapons. If anything, though, theyre a too generously awarded. Ever since seasons were separated from DLC with Season of the Forge and the Black Armoury, each has had a different approach to awarding weapons. Last seasons Menagerie felt like it hit the sweet spot: letting players decide what weapons or armour to chase. The Vex Offensive approach appears to be all guns, all the time. Ive played maybe eight rounds of the event to completion and have somehow amassed nine scout rifles. It feels like overkill.The frequency of new drops, and the lack of a vendor refresh, hides a deeper problem: theres less incentive than ever farm new guns. Ill pick one of the new Undying weapons at random: Loud Lullaby. Its an aggressive frame kinetic hand cannon, and thus up against the tried-and-true Duke Mk. 44 of which, if youve played for any length of time, youll have dismantled hundreds of times.

DO IT.", "Author": "Amanda", "Hours": 3468.2}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 22, 2019", "Review": "Destiny 2 is actually a good game, but due to frequent frustrations, I cant recommend the game unless you are patient and easy going enough to tolerate the downsides in order to enjoy the good parts. I can recommend trying the F2P portion of the game, but I can not recommend rewarding Bungie with money for their DLC and paid content, even though I did.TL;DR: Beautiful game, and fun gameplay. Limited inventory space and frequent server issues and disconnects greatly diminish your ability to enjoy the game.Lets start with the positives:1)  Graphics are beautiful, and nice art design, with some beautiful worlds/maps.2)  Gunplay is fantastic, and different weapons offer great variety to how your gameplay feels.3)  Has a couple of really nice quests, and a bunch more acceptable quests and mini story missions. Overall a good amount of story driven gameplay.4)  You can enjoy a major chunk of the game for free, even though I would call this more of a Free To Try game rather than Free To Play. A true Free To Play game would allow you to play all the content while putting cosmetics and boosters behind paywalls. Destiny is essentially letting you play about 60% of the content for free, but then placing about 40% of the newest content (this includes quests and game modes) behind a paywall. So in essence, you get to try 60% of the game for free before buying the full game. Free To Try! Obviously much more generous than typical game trials, and also no trial expiration time.Now for the negatives that cause too much frustration to allow you to enjoy this game to its full potential:1)  TRASH Servers! Sure, there can be great periods of time where you play without any issues. But then sometimes, you get spammed with \"Contacting Server\" messages, and get thrown out of any game activity and have to start over. This is even more frustrating when it occurs while you are doing solo activities and story missions. Why does Bungie require a constant connection to play even solo activity? Why cant they at least allow the game to pause and go into standby and then resume when it reconnects a few seconds later? Instead, it logs you out, and most times you can log right back in. Sometimes though, their server state gets so bad that you can hardly stay connected for more than a couple of minutes before getting thrown out repeatedly, for half a day at times. This is not my internet issue, as friends from across the world will experience issues at the same time. When it happens enough times, that you get kicked out right before a 30-60 minute mission is about to end within a few more shots, you start to get mad at the game instead of enjoying the game.2)  This one is not a big issue, but still a negative worth noting. When the servers are working, they are so slow to load into maps or player hubs. I installed my game on my NVMe SSD. The game isnt waiting for my PC to load data. Its waiting for the server to load me in. Loading into a player hub takes 30 seconds to over 3 minutes during peak times. Meanwhile, in an actual FreeToPlay game like Warframe, my PC and SSD loads me into a mission or player hub in 10 seconds or less even during peak times! Because Im not waiting on the server in Warframe, but just how fast my SSD and CPU can load the data.3)  The new armor system, with energy affinity, applies an unnecessary layer of RNG on top of the already high level of RNG when it comes to acquiring armor with the stats you want. To make matters worse, armor used to have whole tiers in their stats, and now after Shadowkeep update, the stats fall between tiers. So for example, previously you could get movement/health/recovery of 2:3:5, and now you get  22:28:51  (now every 10 points = 1 tier). So when you stack 4 pieces of armor, each with fractions of tiers, you have to think and calculate more if you want to optimize your stats, as the fractions of a tier dont add any value and you want to avoid having high fractions. Its an unnecessary layer of complexity in combining 4 pieces of armor in your build, and in inventory management.4)  Loot is abundant, and getting weapons you want is easy. However, getting weapons you want with the perks (unique stats) you want is extremely difficult. The RNG could make it so you never know how long you will have to grind to get a specific weapon/perk combo before you start grinding. You could grind for a day, or for weeks and still get unlucky enough to not get it. This makes you dread every grind you set out on, not knowing when you may get your reward. Not knowing if you are willing to invest that much effort if it takes too long. And then what? If you already invested a day, are you willing to give up when you think you might get it within the next hour? You end up suffering through grind and uncertainty, and forcing yourself to keep grinding because you already invested a lot of time grinding for that one item. Being forced to do something, even by yourself, naturally leads an unenjoyable experience.5)  So the game has a feature called Collections. It allows you to reacquire a weapon or armor piece you already found before, sometimes. If a weapon has random perks, as most do, you cant reacquire it. So for the most part, this feature is pointless. Also, reacquired armor will always have trash stats compared to the original copy you get from random drops, so also pointless. This in itself wouldnt be a big deal if we could keep whatever we find in the first place, but the next point combined with this is the biggest frustration I personally face.6)  LIMITED Inventory in a LOOTER Game!! So, we can only hold up to 500 items (weapons+armor) in our vault, or 740 items total including the space on your 3 characters. So, again, this on its own wouldnt be an issue if you could reacquire from collections any items you delete cause you dont need them right now. But you cant. And the sheer amount of loot you obtain as you play compounds this issue even further. Too often, my friend or I want to log in to play, but we cant play cause our vault is full, and we have to spend hours trying to decide which 50 items we want the least and can delete. Then we play for a day or 2 and the vault is full again.7)  Arbitrary limited inventory space not only for weapons and armor, but for many other items too. Stuff like shaders (what you use to paint your gear), bounties+quests, and other resources. Why cant we hold more than 50 different shaders when the game has about 100 or more different shaders you will obtain as you play and loot!? Why am I being forced to try to decide which shaders I will delete to make room for other shaders? Bungie makes a bizarre design choice to tell you \"Look at all this fancy loot you can get, only if you grind the game even though you paid $70 for the game, but you also dont get to keep all of it!\" BUT WHY!?8)  No way to buy more inventory space even if you are willing to give them money for it, as my friend and I would be willing to do.9)  ABSURDLY OVERPRICED microtransaction items in the ingame store. This is not even a true FreeToPlay game. Even if it was, the prices would still be too high. After Paying $70 for their 2 DLC (my friend paid much more as he started playing on day 1, for all the past content that is now free), Bungie wants me to pay $20 for 3 finisher animations. Thats the price of a full game!! A finisher animation that last 3 seconds! 10)  The built in friend system, social, clan and chat is horribly minimal and offers very little use. There is no ingame friend list. It only plugs into your Steam friends list. So you cant even appear offline in steam if you want to play with your friend, as it wont let you receive invites.11)  There are a few other things I would mention, but I need to check stuff ingame to be accurate in my statements, and I cant log into the game right now. Their servers have been down for the past 12 hours as I write this, and no one can log in.", "Author": "jRazz", "Hours": 3486.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 17, 2019", "Review": "Not bad", "Author": "FuzZzy", "Hours": 140.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 17, 2019", "Review": "this game is like crack cocaine.

Bungie you may or may not read but if you do I hope you take what I say into consideration. Ive been a fan of Bungie since Halo. Im pretty sure any true gamer nerd here is. So when I discovered in my local gamestop that Destiny 1 was going to be a thing. I preordered it. Day 1 of launch I made my titan. My pretty blue hair babygirl. Ive never fell more in love with a game than I did during that first day. With every new strike, every new expansion [Darkbelowbeingthebest], every new raid[KingsFallbeingthebest]. I fell more and more and more into Destiny. If you know me, If you know my life then youd know that I have devoted my entire life to Destiny since 2014. I own 12 copies of Destiny 1. 12 hard copies. For both playstation and xbox. That is how much of a destiny 1 fan I was. I devoted my time to playing destiny 1 both on playstation and xbox. It was a lot to keep up with. I own both white Destiny ps4s. The basic white one, And the one with the map. Every poster for every expansion. Every shirt, hoodie, pants, cup, mug. I own everything destiny. Thats how devoted I got. I know I sound \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 crazy. Maybe I am. When I heard Rise of Iron was the final expansion for destiny 1. I cried. No Offense bungie, Rise of Iron was \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Destiny 1 deserved a better way to end. With the start of Destiny 2, the fall of home.[TheTower] i cried. Having to see the tower destroyed. I seriously cried. For years my titan has called The Tower home. With the launch and fail of Curse and warmind. I began to think destiny was dead. With the launch of Forsaken I began to have hope again. 395 Last Wish Clears later I still have hope that destiny will become what It once was. Shadowkeep. Going back to the moon, the moon is where I fell in love with destiny. So falling for destiny all over again on the moon. Shadowkeep kinda makes me feel like I am playing destiny 1. I know you can make it better.  The community of destiny knows you failed us with the launch of destiny 2.  I know that isnt your fault bungie. I know for a fact I have supplied your company with a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ton of money. I own every collectors edtion of  Destiny 1 for both playstation 3 & Playstation 4 & Xbox 360 & Xbox One. I own the collectors edition for destiny 2 for playstation 4, xbox one and finally PC. The about of merch I have bought over the years. The amount of physical ghost shells Ive bought. I do this willingly  because I am a collector. Because I want to support this company the best way I can. I know I am not alone when it comes to collecting destiny things. I have met so many others like me. So when I say this I know I am not just specking for myself. The launch of destiny 2 was a fail, it  broke my heart completely. with Shadowkeep, feel much better. But I know for a fact you can use the money Ive been giving this company to listen to the player base. give us what we want.  yes giving us new content is also what we want. But giving us destiny 1 again on PC is also what we want. Since you wont do that. With the infinite forest, with us being able to go back in time. I really think you should use that to your advantage. Dont just use it for events. If you do use it for events. Make it less boring please. I honestly think you can used it, to bring in the destiny 1 raids. The storylines you can make for us having to go back and do those raids could be great if you make them. You dropped activision. Thank god, this means you can control Destiny now. You can give the fan base what we want. Slowly merge destiny 1 &2. I know for a fact. No one will be mad. You can even make it paid content. I will gladly give you 1000 for it. Bring back trials. not of the nine either. REAL trials. Trials Of Osris. Let him host it.Bring back Venus. Let us go back to the orginal map of Earth and Mars. Whatever you do, Please. PLEASE. Do not turn crucible into fortnite type crap  Activsion is no longer apart of this company. Use that to your advantage. Finally make destiny what both the company and fan base want. Please.  Also. Please. Please. Bring me back my Lethe Noblesse.

The game it self is very fun, the maps aka Planets are quite big, there isnt much limit as to how far you can explore, tho the thing is, other than Forsaken, which is imo be biggest expansion, the game feels quite lacking. Dont get me wrong the content is out there, and the number of unique items is pretty good as well... PvE seems more polished than PvP, I dont belive they have dedicated servers for PvP, so sometimes it can be quite frustrating trading kills (That happens way too often) That being said, its a FPS game with RPG elements, you cant really go crazy as far as \"Builds\" go, tho the options are there. Now to get to the main point, with all that being said, the game really shines when you group a couple of friends and do this specific activity called \"Raid\", this is one of the most fun and enjoying elements of this game, and makes all other games feels lacking when it comes to PvE content. Tho I get that some of you may not have 5 friends that are willing to invest time in this game so raiding may be out of reach, BUT thats where all the diffrent LFG sites / apps / and discord servers come in handy.P.S. The raiding experience is amazing if done blind, meaning if you dont watch a guide, or a video on it, it can provide you with some of the most joyfull / frustrating moments.That all being said, if youre looking for a \"competitive\" fps game with PvE elements to it, this isnt it, or at least I wouldnt bother taking pvp priority in this game instead of all the fun elements of PvE.Thats pretty much it, if you have time to spare, and want to main a game, if youre ready for grinding out some of the weapons that are now a priority, then this is the game for you.Edit: The game devs are looking to support this game for years to come, so itll receive patches quite often, and it always keeps the game fresh", "Author": "Yahudi", "Hours": 495.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 6, 2019", "Review": "With the advent of D2 year 4 rapidly approaching and after putting around 2000 hours into Destiny 2 between Battle.net and Steam, I thought I would come up with an actual review for once. This review will be broken up into 4 sections covering both the PVE and the PVP portions of the game, Reward Structure, and General Gameplay. Keep in mind that at the time of writing, Beyond Light has not been released yet so some aspects of my review may be invalidated. With all that being said, lets take a look at my current opinion on Destiny 2:PVE:Pros:  Satisfying variety of gameplay modes. Multiple Difficulty options allow you to cater the experience to your liking. Most PVE modes have automatic matchmaking. Raids; These pinnacle 6 player activities are a must try.Cons:  PVE content loop becomes stale at endgame level. Overuse of \u201cartificial difficulty\u201d at higher difficulties, e.g. Insta-kill mechanics or extremely tanky enemies. No internal LFG system exists for Raids or other non-matchmade PVE modes.PVP:Pros:  Gunplay and player movement feels crisp and enjoyable. Great build variety allows you to experiment with different builds at your leisure. Large map and game mode variety.Cons:  Seasonal metas limit your loadouts in order for you to be successful in higher level play. The existence of problematic \u201cPinnacle weaponry\u201d leads to unfavorable gameplay conditions. Matchmaking is very inconsistent; YMMV. Cheaters run rampant in higher level PVP modes.Reward Structure:Pros:  Large variety of weaponry and armor. Interesting perk combinations available on weapons. Higher level play rewards increased resources and better stat-rolled armor.Cons:  Majority of rewards are/feel useless. Rewards feel very repetitive at times. In recent seasons, many top tier rewards have basically been given out for free, as opposed to being earned through skilled play.General Gameplay:Pros:  Core gameplay loop is fairly simple yet enjoyable. Wide range of weaponry and build variety allow you to play the game in your own way. Most quests are accomplishable within a reasonable time. Play alone or team up with friends; The choice is yours.Cons:  Lack of consistent gear balancing leads to very strict seasonal metas. New Player Experience is poorly designed. In-Game UI is heavily segmented and can be a hassle to navigate. The physics engine can be a little... obtuse at times.Thanks for Reading, Hope this review helped you.Also, Ill let you in on a little secret: Ada-1 is best waifu, you cant change my mind.

There have been and will be times where it feels like game is incredibly stagnant with trash, recycled content. There are many aspects of the game where I could definitely say that are unsatisfactory. I dont need to tell you its flaws. There are many other reviews with extensive explanations of why Eververse (in-game cosmetic store) has gone to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, why multiple different changes to the games economy over time has made the grind horrible, etc.What im writing this review for, is to ask you to give this game a shot.Despite all the flaws, this game has incredible gunplay, with an extremely diverse variety of gamemodes to choose from. I dont think Ive really experienced any other game like Destiny, where gear retains the exact same abilities and perks between PvE and PvP gamemodes while making both feel fun and (relatively) balanced to play. Ive seen alot of comparisons to Warframe by others, but I feel like Warframes PvP is more or less non-existent, and this is just my opinion, but the use of randomly generated tilesets as 90% of mission areas in Warframe is really boring and makes you feel like youre running around a gigantic maze. Sometimes, Destiny delivers bad content that makes you not feel like playing, and you can read up all about it from other reviewers. But you dont have to play that content. You dont have to dedicate your entire gaming time to playing only Destiny.Like I said, this game is not for everyone. However, despite the ups and downs of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and awesome content that this game goes through, many people just cant stay away. There really isnt any other game quite like it. With the addition (and constant improvements) of new light (F2P and new player experience), I strongly urge you to download this game and try it out for at least a few hours.

It is ok for it to be hard, but not because a vex teleported 50 feet behind the pillar and you didnt see it, or a mote you have to collet to fall through the floor or the boss being an a.. that stands way 2 far away for the tether to hit it.Mistakes are very unforgiving i destiny 2 since there is a token mechanic in all raids and the timer once a member is dead, bungie should get rid of the timer and let people finish the fight even if half of the team is dead just like in destiny 1.Now for the Season pass Vex Offensive:For now, its kind of ok and kinda not.The grind for your artifact is heavy if you plan on getting higher than the 100 season pass lvls.If you are a progress player or a player that wants to do the hard stuff, you will have to get past 200 to get your artifact to 20+I am right now season pass lvl 224 and my artifact is at +20 for me to hit 980 to be at equal power lvl as the hardest activities in game I will need to do another 120+ season lvls to get it to 28 or higher, because of the heavy RNG in pinnacle gear.The daylis and the small story you get with the vex offensive is good but not great.The loot pool from Ikora is small 1 armor piece for every slot and 4 weapons.The exotic bow leviathans breath is a fun weapon but lacks heavy DMG in PvE.In PvP this weapon is a monster because it 1 shoots you and you wont see it coming ( like rockets or grenades )Its also kinda sad that the vex Event does not have rotating bosses and always has the same boss, this will change on the 11.19 once the undying mind boss releases.The PVP situation is kinda meh, since destiny 2 hit steam and new light ( free model ) you will face cheaters from time to time and it can be frustrating.It is also sad that destiny does not have Dedicated Servers, i know this wont change in destiny 2 anymore but for PVP this was not a good decision.Pros:+ Lot of stuff to do.+ The gun play is damn awesome.+ You feel powerful once you have the good guns+ You can solo a lot+ the story is good if you dont skip it+ a ton of challenges if you want to do them++++++++ the communityCons- cheaters / hackers in PVP every once in a wile- bad matchmaking solo players hit 4 / 6 Enemy teams in PVP / gambit- Raid to technical for new players- the Eververse ( emote / ship shop ) is a bit pricey for a few thingsVery good game with a few hiccup but worth your time and money.So far guardian see you on the moon!", "Author": "D\u039bV\u039e", "Hours": 2533.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 25, 2019", "Review": "UPDATE 2022: At some point in your life you will question yourself: \"Why did I buy this game?\"content is repetitive, weapons are re-used with only few exceptions.

It stretches not only to Eververse store but game in general. - What if that gun xur brought today will not appear for another eternity? gotta check him every Friday (and potentially glitch him on Tuesday). - What if quest line which is easy right now will be a nightmare later on? (ex. Bad Juju quest line in 2020)- what if catalyst which is available right now will stop dropping later on due to removal of content or other reasons? (you cannot get a number of catalysts for exotics rn which were available at some point) - what if weapon which drops with certain perks will be changed to not drop specific combo you liked? that happened to number of weapons already. and the biggest one: - what if cheese/exploit are people using right now to get faster clears will be fixed? and that last one is happening constantly, at this point I am starting to think that Bungie does that stuff on purpose to see hype on YouTube around certain bugs or exploits.

However the endgame is very grindy and most of the advance content cannot be completed unless you have a guild or group of friends. As for classes there are no specific build variations because none of them really matters that much, unlike Warframe or Borderlands, the game wants you to shoot as much as possible. When it comes to PvE, the casual contents are simple, such as world quests, bounties, and dungeon(strikes), they are not as rewarding as advance content such as nightfall(harder dungeons) and raids. PvP is a fast way to get gear, since winning a match will give you some gear 100%, if..you are good enough to win that is. Gambits is a PvPvE mode, this mode is mainly PvE, however you can also kill the player on the other team in order to slow down their progress, I do enjoy this part of the game. So if you are looking for a pretty graphic and simple looter shooter this is the game for you!Veteran or returning players:I have spent almost 2000 hours on this game when it was launched on Battle.Net. Ive played through the raids, gambits, strikes, PvP etc, but after i got tired of this game, the grind isnt fun, not that i am not willing grind, it just not fun to grind. The gear you obtain doesnt even matter because the only stat they have is the light level, and with some somewhat useful perks attached to some gear, only Exotic quality item will have an unique look and effect. I think old players will understand how to felt when the quests literally tells you to complete some world quests in order to get a \"powerful gear\" ingram. If you think Bungi escaped from Activision will change the flavor of their content then you are wrong, same stuff same content. Story is just garbage as usual because adding grind in the main campaign for Shadowkeep is totally necessary to tell a GREAAAT story. If you are veteran and you like the game, good for you, i wont tell you to stop playing, and ignore everything i said, but if you are returning player and wish to give this game a go agane, pls dont it is a waste of money and should go save it and buy Borderlands 3.", "Author": "KONODIODA", "Hours": 22.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 5, 2019", "Review": "Nice game", "Author": "\ud83d\udc99Kisyana\ud83d\udc99", "Hours": 5.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 2, 2019", "Review": "very epic", "Author": "CarceusRKO", "Hours": 484.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 5, 2019", "Review": "The best paid online looter shooter game just went free to play, without all the junk that usually entails.

Bungie doesnt always get everything right. Vanilla D2 at release left much to be desired, and plenty of things that had become common place at the end of Year 3 for D1 were suddenly gone and it felt like a step backwards. The first two content drops of D2 were also lackluster.But there is something to be said about this games stability, gun play, atmosphere, etc. The game feels amazing. Always has. By the time Forsaken had come out for the second year of D2, Bungie had once again found their stride like they did in D1. It took a while to find out what worked and didnt work. This is ultimately not surprising for a live service game. Forsaken improved upon so many aspects of the game that it very quickly began to feel like there was too much to do. The following annual pass for D2 also had ups and downs but they werent as severe to the core experience of the game as they were in the first year.

The grind to get to the highest power level and the end game activities that you have to perform in order to acquire the latter, is what keeps me coming back for more. The introduction of Seasons was one of the best moves by Bungie imo. It kept Destiny fresh until new contents were introduced.  One of the aspects that makes Destiny a cut above the rest, for me, is the  soundtrack. I cant even begin to explain how cinematic and astounding the music is in this game.

In fact, it is probably better than ever with its balancing, new features and content updates. The community is very dedicated and passionate about this franchise and the player count is still very healthy, peaking at about 70k players every day (keeping in mind that there are a lot more console players).The game is set up to have a one big yearly expansion that usually brings a new raid, destinations and large story expansion; and 4 seasonal smaller updates that bring new activities, dungeons and continue with the story narrative. So you need to shell out about $100 a year to keep playing. New content keeps coming and the old content is getting sunset. You will not find the same activities that were available last year, or the year before. There is definitely an element of FOMO and \u201cyou had to be there\u201d. On the other hand, these older activities lose their popularity over time and the number of activities may seem overwhelming for new players. GameplayDestiny is kind of like an MMO, but not really. Instead it is basically a co-op looter shooter. Everything revolves around guns and getting them sweet god rolls. Every activity in the game is designed to be played many, many times. While the first few runs are definitely cool and exciting, after a 100th clear you question your sanity. Do I even need a gun that badly? Is it worth it? Sometimes it isn\u2019t, yet we still grind for it. Sometimes the gun won\u2019t even be used, but it\u2019s just nice to have it for the collection. This gameplay loop is not for everybody and the majority will not see the point.But it doesn\u2019t need to be like that. You may choose to play an activity just a few times, be satisfied with subpar gun rolls, and just play until it becomes a nuisance. Ultimately, you can play just for the new content. Being primarily a PvE game, Destiny will live and die by the new content. Right now Bungie made a 3 year commitment to yearly expansions, which may or may not expand past that. Once there is no new content to play through, I don\u2019t know how the game would keep going.LoreThe storytelling is probably one of the strongest parts of Destiny. The theme of light and darkness is a familiar narrative but the history of all that happened, the background behind all the lore, it is all very detailed and interesting. There is an overarching metanarrative that spans from Destiny 1 along with the smaller pieces in the seasonal format that push the story along. A big problem is that none of this is well explained to new players. If you are just starting the game, you will have no idea what the story is, who the people are, what the point of anything is, what to do next, none of this is explained. You need to do your own research if you want to know any of these things. There is a great YouTube channel called \u201cMy name is Byf\u201d that has been covering all the lore of Destiny for years. I highly recommend his \u201cComplete Story of Destiny\u201d video to get caught up. PvPThe core gunplay in PvP can be very fun. But just like in any ability heavy game, there are often times where abilities and supers ruin your game. There are issues with balancing, there are often guns that release too hot and take a while to nerf, there is a big hand cannon meta, but overall it can be fun at times. The ranked system as it stands currently is a joke. It has potential to be good but it needs a major overhaul.It feels like it has been years without a PvP content update. Recently Trials have been reworked and made more accessible for all players. Ability/super cooldowns have been reworked for PvP. It feels like a foundation is being set up for future updates. We need more game modes and a ranked rework. Bungie has confirmed they are still committed to PvP, we just have to wait and see.TLDRDestiny 2 is a great game that is hard to recommend. The story narrative is fantastic and the gunplay is very engaging. The gameplay loop becomes grindy and repetitive, it turns into a nuisance after a while. For new players the game is very confusing. There is no clear indication of what to do or what the story is. It takes a long time to catch up. The endless grinding for god rolls is probably not that exciting. Ultimately the game is what you make of it.

Found Several bugs within the game since release such as (not getting the new exotic pulse rifle from the stranger), Disconnections at random times a.k.a (throwing grenades , transitioning to area of the map) Europa as a new area feels too big with less amounts of enemies (makes me think of the driving simulator exp than more COMBAT RELATED THINGS TO ADD MORE)  since there was no backbone plot other than big momma fallen having darkness as a weapon and lack of actually having any good build up like the forsaken DLC ....... FORSAKEN>BEYOND LIGHT being very bluntly honest about this one bungie.  makes me feel like dropping said money on a preorder that was half baked like buying No mans sky when it was first released. Pros 1: Graphical design of the weapons and monsters/MOBS that you fight keeps getting better in PVE side 2: each exotic has its gimmicks and style of play.3: base story and forsaken were one of the best moments to the Destiny 2 series. 4: each subclass made it seem awsome to make awsome builds for both PVP and PVE. Cons 1: Still Havent solved the issue of an Anti-Cheat system still has loop holes even with said rollback.2: Bungie decided Gambit needed a change (lack of creativity they decided to merge prime gambit and gambit into one as a way to save face)3: Stasis is pretty much the new meta ....... Stasis > mountain top ....Cant fix mountain top so they decide to make a biger broken thing to add and call that \"FIXING\" 4: Beyond Light DLC is more a buyers remorse than feeling confident about buying something both having good content and actual fixes that should of already been made before the major release (since they felt LAZY )", "Author": "TTVAbigorTheRaged", "Hours": 725.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 27, 2019", "Review": "Moving whole Year 1 content to F2P, especially on Steam, gave this game second life.

Gunplay is great, skills and weapon traits provide an additional layer to building your character and looking for the way you want to play Destiny 2. Definitely worth checking!UPDATE September 2021Some time has passed already, sunsetting is also done and new content is landing quite often with bright future shaping on the horizon for Destiny 2.The current state of the game? From a narrative standpoint, it is superb! Really: most of the seasonal games (GaaS) should learn how to approach plot, reveals, characters, and world-shaping. The last time I had this time with seasonal content was back in the Scarlet days in Guild Wars 2.Content-wise it is a mixed bag. We are getting new activities, usually something like a horde mode with few steps each of the seasons (the seasonal arenas) and some small instances for fireteams of three. It was some time already since the new Dungeon was introduced (there are currently 3 in the game) and the new raid (Vault of Glass remake) was opened for players.The last remake of Trials (end-game PvP content) added some life to this part of the game, but there is also a downside - The BattlEye software. Still waiting on the clarification on data collection from Bungie. Adding anti-cheat and not changing tickrate (it is 10 or something) is a little sad, but the priority here was the cheaters, so maybe in the future, we can expect better PvP.In simple words: I would recommend this game, as there is a lot to do, especially for new and returning players.

Initially, the leveling system for powerful gear was garbage. So after about 150 hours playing Destiny 2 on PlayStation,  I had to quit.When I found out Destiny 2 would be available on PC I had to pick it up! I had a lot more steam and battle.net friends and they all seem very interested in the game. I played the game for another 200 hours on Blizzard and it was the same thing... level up to the soft cap and then grind the game until you had no will to live. So I got fed up again and took another break.Jump to the present expansion, Shadowkeep. Being a long time fan of the Destiny lore and story line I was so excited. Initially the game was amazing and the new add-on to the story was excellent! But then came season passes.Here are the real reasons I do not recommend Destiny 2:Season Passes:The season pass content is dull. Its just permits even more grinding and if you want to get exclusive (and primarily cosmetic) items you have to pay for the season passes. Games should not be based on season pass content and should rather focus on developing story through free/paid expansions. The new emphasis within the gaming community for season passes makes it seem like games now are pay to win or pay for rewards. I get micro-transactions, but a whole other paid system? No. Not acceptable. Community:In Destiny 1, the community was much more open and did not exclude those who needed help. Even those with a max light level and at the end-game content would be a \"sherpa\" to those who were new and needed guidance. Now, the community is toxic. It is full of people who are stuck up with themselves and not willing to include new people. You either need to have a specific K/D for crucible events, a specific light level for vanguard events, or a certain number of raid/dungeon clears to even think about getting a fireteam through the LFG system. Instead of bettering the community by helping, people tend to drive others way through their exclusive groups and/or requirements.To a new player:If you have recently bought the game, enjoy it! It is a great game with many amazing story-lines and quests. You are likely to have a couple hundred hours or so going through campaigns and exotic quests. However, there is a line that you will reach where to advance any further you have to move to end-game content. For those activities you need a fireteam, and unless you have really nice friends or a group that you have been playing with for a while, then you might be out of luck. Personally, I have spent hours on the Destiny LFG Discord looking for fireteams, and to no avail.The game had a lot of potential, but I cannot recommend it anymore.

The PVP is still crap though.   It honestly probably will never be good.  The makers of the game have unabashedly favored hand cannons since this game started. The hand Cannon is the safest main in the game, with the biggest damage, that require the least skill to aim. Those are all facts. If hand cannon were just the best tactical advantage, every elite force in the world would be using high caliber pistols in real life. They dont, which mean something is being severely helped in this game. 1) Hand Cannons have insane aim assist. I slowed the video to 25% of a very famous Youtuber, and LITERALLY counted the shots that were ACTUAL head shots vs counted as head shots. This Youtuber hit maybe 25 to 30% but it appeared as headshot 50 to 55% of the time. This was a top tier player filming his play on Javelin-4 , I watched them shoot someone in the KNEE while this person jumped and it registered as a HEADSHOT!!!!!! It was so far off I couldnt believe it. I watched it 6 times to see if this was correct. It definitely was. 2) Peak shooting also allows them to be the SAFEST main in the game. You can be exposed for a brief split second to fire. Then once you hit you do SO MUCH damage per bullet!!! This combined with the serious grading curve of headshots, is where bungie HELPS this architype. A real weapon of any kind to the head would be a death sentence. Bungie lowers damage of most architypes, but kept more of the stopping power of some. Hand Cannons have more per bullet, when really all weapons should kill almost NEVER survive a shot to the head. They do this is all while having a REDICULOUS handicap to aim. There are a lot of people considered great players in this game with great movement, but mediocre accuracy walking tall with a strong headshot average. A great many of them cant actually aim for \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, but destiny helps that along. I would laugh to watch them in just about any other FPS... 3) Hand cannons have competitive range compared to most other architypes, with great in air accuracy because of the firing style and the damage per round. Even keeping up with longer range rifles. That crap is almost laughably inaccurate... all the way around. I know, its fantasy so what... blah blah blah. Its hard to take it seriously... It really is, or put any weight to the skill of aiming in this game with that crap. Its a lot harder to stay alive when only one ACTUAL shot to the head kills you, and also easier to stay alive when a bullet 2 feet from your head doesnt hit you when it shouldnt. Maybe the \"dad\" rifle hitting you in the head 8 times kills you the 1st round, and then all of a sudden a hand cannon is not so luxurious or a status symbol. It becomes the liability it really is. Otherwise elite fighting forces would start carrying large caliber pistols into battle instead of the HK MP7a1 sub machine gun fitted with suppressor that killed Bin Laden. Just a thought....  Last but not least,  I looked at Destiny stat tracker leader boards,  93% of the top 100 are on consoles.  A Steam top player doesnt show up until #18 and the other 6 are #73 and higher. Consoles have even more insane stickiness to their Aim Assist (lets just call it what it is AIM BOT).  That many console player is the top 100 (93 of the 100) is a statistical impossibility.  The Destiny aim bot is helping that along.  Dont get me started on sniper weapons being pulled out and aimed down scope (dialed in and everything) quicker that a real person could pull out a small sidearm....

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with this franchise and the various issues that the game has come across. It seems that Destiny is constantly in a state of having a significant issue that goes against the player, and Destiny 2 is no stranger to this issue, naturally.Destiny 2 can be fun with friends, the guns always feel good, the exotics can be fun to play and experiment with, and raids are amazing content; however, this is where praise ends.One of the greatest problems with Destiny 2 is absolutely the content vaulting. With the release of Beyond Light, the fifth expansion to Destiny 2, a large chunk of content was wiped from the game entirely. This included Mercury, Mars, Titan, The Leviathan, and the Farm. This is a tremendous loss once you take into account the activities that were housed with these planets, such as strikes, crucible maps, exotic quests, vendors, and raids. That\u2019s 6 locations, 5 raids, 15 exotic quests, 2 unique exotic activities, 2 raid exotics, 11 crucible maps, 2 Gambit maps, 7 strikes, and 8 vendors. If Destiny 2 had started free to play, this blow may not be as severe as it is; it is still absolutely devastating, but this content was paid for and then taken away. Most people paid for the base game, paid for the DLCs, and then those DLCs were shelved. Even if the content within the DLCs that were removed were not necessarily great, it\u2019s still content people paid for. This decision is inexcusable, and has made me uneasy about supporting any DLC content in the future. Your purchases are not stable, and will be taken away if Destiny 2 becomes over 80GB of storage space.Sunsetting was another issue that has since been resolved in some capacity, and the game is slowly recovering from this. Sunsetting was the system by which weapons and armor would not be able to increase their power. Weapons and Armor that are at a cap, and cannot be increased in power, are forever locked into either patrols, or casual PvP, as their low power will make you weaker overall for anything that your power / light level will make a difference. The weaponry and armor inside Forsaken and Shadowkeep; the oldest DLCs that have not yet been vaulted; have only recently started recovery from being sunset back in November of 2020. This is only for world drop weapons, however. These items should not have been sunset to begin with, as the content they drop from is still active and still purchasable. You can still buy these DLCs that have some equipment that you cannot bring with you outside of the most mundane activities.This only scratches the surface of issues that face Destiny 2. I\u2019m writing this more as a warning or caution for people interested in playing or purchasing any DLC. I would love more than anything to be able to recommend this game to you, I would love the additional content to be worth your money, but it simply is not. You would get more value out of your dollar by playing slots.", "Author": "Zaokllr", "Hours": 1479.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 6, 2021", "Review": "Destiny is, and I believe, always will be, an absolutely fantastic franchise. There are a million and one things that someone can get annoyed about just like almost every game. And I understand not everyone has had the experience I have (Playing since the beginning of Destiny 1), but it truly is one of the greatest games I have ever played.You are immersed into a world that excites but at the same time keeps you on your toes. Since I started playing at the age of 12 even till now in my adulthood, this game has brought me so much joy. Obviously theyve had to adapt the larger the game got and the more money they had to bring in. But I do believe theyve have done quite well to retain most of the original feeling of Destiny and Destiny 2. This has all still felt like one cohesive story and play experience since I bought Destiny 2 first release. My profile is deceptive as I have over 2,000 hours on this game if you include my time on Playstation and before Bungie migrated to Steam, and honestly this game has never upset me to the point I didnt feel like playing. For new players today, yes there is alot to catch up on and it may be frustrating having to learn every quest and where to get what stuff but, that is the fun of it. I have always felt a rush when that grinding for a certain weapon or loot paid off. Raiding with your friends, it will never fail to bring laughs and a thrill. Crucible (PvP) is the same as almost any PVP, it will get annoying, but thats mostly not Bungies fault. I love this game from the bottom of my heart and am happy to keep playing it almost solely based on the joy its brought so far. I used to jump when a thrall came at me in a cave. Now I take down giant time travelling robots. Its immersive, it provides an incredible amount of content (some might find it short as they only play campaign missions but I assure you, find a destiny discord server or have just 5 friends to do endgame missions and you will not be disappointed with how much you can do), it brings a crazy sense of pride and thrill when you complete difficult challenges (and you are rewarded), it has real re-playablility (as you can playthrough as all 3 classes without restarting your first pick), and completionists are rewarded with really cool titles and seals that show your dedication.Thankyou Destiny.", "Author": "Weetbix \u30c4", "Hours": 746.7}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: September 20, 2021", "Review": "Jokes aside about the 69 hours i have in game on this profile (nice)I am a Destiny 1, day 1 veteran on Xbox. I have played that game for close to 5000 hours in total over the many years since its release, and i loved every moment of it. For the most part, the game was well made, carefully catered to and patched as needed, and the developers always kept the player-base in mind. The base game told the beautiful story of the guardians of the light pitted against the overwhelming forces of darkness, and though outnumbered and outgunned, our guardians always came out on top because of sheer will. Dark below told of the things that lurked behind closed doors, and could even be a metaphor for the demons we sometimes even hide from ourselves. The taken king, a story of showing the humanity of even the dark parts of life. Showing that some people or events are just truly in the eye of the beholder. And finally, rise of iron, a story of the enemy sacrificing what humanity they had just to survive. It showed that both sides struggle, and there is no victor in a battle, only one who loses less. On top of the epic and meaningful stories, the dev team always paid attention to the games prices, making sure both micro-transactions and expansions were not necessary to have a meaningful experience in the game, though if you chose to buy them you would never be disappointed with the product. A beautiful game.I bought destiny 2 with the pre-order, and at launch, yes, the game was a bit mediocre, but still very fun, and enjoyable to play. Though yes, the grind was a bit lacking, that was okay, because it allowed more casual players to hop in more easily. Besides, we had hope for two more whole expansions. As the expansions released, those who had ordered the season pass were content, we ordered all the content for the games life-cycle, and now we had it (or so we thought). The story of the red war was interesting, showing us that guardians, and we as people were important even without magical space powers. Osiris made us think of every possibility, and redefine how our choices could be made. Though i didnt play warmind much, it seemed to be an interesting story as well, about the hope that always remained within us all. The microtransactions were cosmetic, and usually pretty small. the expansions were not overpriced on their own either. I invested $140 on the game, and got my moneys worth to be honest. i was happy, that is until forsaken came out.though a fun expansion, when forsaken came out, it was an additional $50 on top of the season pass, which may i add was marketed to include ALL future destiny 2 in-game content. Reluctantly i purchased the expansion, hoping to have a good bout of fun for the money i paid, killing monsters, and avenging one of the meaningful characters we had grown up alongside. I played it, and it was alright. Worth $50, possibly, though i was still disappointed with the lack of regard for customers. It was at this point that i took a couple years hiatus from the game. Upon my return, i now played on pc, before cross save, so i started over. Not a big deal, because it was quite nostalgic playing it again. once again, i took a break, assuming that by the time i had a better pc, all the content would be waiting for me again, and i would be able to fight my sworn enemy Ghaul again, experience the infinite forest, and save the warmind once again. I am very displeased to report that when i came back, all of the content that i had paid for, close to $200 of content, wasnt even in the game any more. Instead, the content was replaced by meaningless micro-transactions, at overly inflated prices. Three \"large\" $50 expansions awaited, and none were even available for me. Asides from that for now, i linked my account to my Xbox account, and unfortunately linked the wrong Xbox account. Upon messaging customer support, all they were willing to help me with was buying more DLC, and so my steam account was locked out of other cross saves for 90 days. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ACTION. Due to that i had to make an entirely new account to cross save with my old Xbox account, and to my avail, upon logging in, all my years of effort were redundant. I couldnt use my old weapons or armor. I couldnt access some of my favourite content. and i couldnt even access the expansion that i had already purchased. In short, thank you Bungie, for taking my $200 and telling me to go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 myself. Reluctantly, once more, i decided i would give the game a chance, and so i purchased Forsaken once more, and Beyond Light. To nobodys surprise, i have been so disappointed with the utter lack of content, and \"give me your money just to play for a little while until your content is inevitably gone\" business practice. Quests are glorified bounties, and no longer meaningful dedicated missions like back in Destiny 1.Regardless of all of the setbacks, i have hope for the future of destiny, and i will continue to play for my friends who love the game. Before you go buy this game, truly, i can not suggest the opposite enough. New players, do not waste your time. Wait a while until Bungie has turned their coin and improved their business practices. And as for the returning players, or Destiny 1 veterans like myself, you wont find any nostalgia here.

PvE, PvP, hell even PvPvE. You can hunt for the lore of the universe and learn everything about the epic stories from within. You can grind it like the grindy Action MMO it is. You can just casually play without DLC and it will still provide you with replayability!A big complaint from the gaming community is how expensive it is to keep up with the game. I understand this greatly and can only say, though it is expensive to enjoy the game to it\u2019s fullest, it definitely delivers and gives you the joy.There\u2019s a well written story in every single expansion.. except for Curse of Osiris but it\u2019s not as bad as people make it look like. There are tons of weapons for tons of playstyles, every class has it\u2019s importance and distinct features and you can play with all of them!The community is a double-edged sword and you will find all kinds of people while playing. You\u2019ll sometimes come across the most chill friends you can make and sometimes you\u2019ll find toxicity, but trust me the former is more common in the PvE parts. All in all before judging it by what you\u2019ve heard, give this looter a chance! Sure it may not be as legendary as a Borderlands game but it just keeps on giving and bettering itself.

While it may be a masterclass of gameplay, world-building, art and general design, the decisions Bungie has made in maintaining the health of the game and adding content to it since their split from original series publisher Activision have been...less than ideal.I will allow that since they have become self-published, Bungie has a great deal less funding to spend on creating the larger, yearly expansions of yore, opting instead for the seasonal model of drip feeding smaller amounts of content to keep income consistent. Myself and many others have come to terms with this model being the new norm, despite how irritatingly shallow and MTX-laden it usually is. The quality of Bungies work has fluctuated hugely when it comes to new expansions, but as of December 2021, it feels as if theyre hitting their stride once again.In the previous iteration of this review, I could not recommend the game on the basis of the overtuned Stasis subclasses thoroughly outshining all other forms of play, in both PvE and PvP content, along with complaints about general balancing and content dropping. As of the 30th Anniversary Update however, enormous balance changes to the Crucible environment, as well as a wealth of new intermediary content drops, have allowed me to genuinely enjoy playing the game for the first time in a long while. I will always have criticisms of the game, such as the abysmal experience for new players (but frankly, thats just because I care and I want the game to be the best it can be). Some folks still gripe about the particular model of expansions that Bungie uses, but its the very same one that nearly every MMO has been using for decades. The monetisation could certainly be toned down, and more free content more frequently would go a long way to retaining players and bringing back old ones, but overall it seems to me that Bungie is closer to finding a balance between all these myriad factors.", "Author": "Wolven", "Hours": 922.3}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 27, 2020", "Review": "no.", "Author": "Adrenochrome Junkie", "Hours": 3544.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 3, 2019", "Review": "Great fun when playing with a group of friends, otherwise you feel like you are on a continuous monotone grind for loot.", "Author": "SniperNeko", "Hours": 0.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 1, 2019", "Review": "With this game finally being F2P I see no excuse for anyone to not play this game at least once.", "Author": "MorkusBorkus", "Hours": 1001.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 2, 2019", "Review": "FREE FROM THE YOKE OF ACTIVI$ION", "Author": "aeranval", "Hours": 261.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 11, 2019", "Review": "Havent played this game long enough to give a solid review. ;)", "Author": "ItsMeTonyG", "Hours": 4118.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 29, 2019", "Review": "Destiny 2, a game I got for free a while back when it was the 1 year anniversary for PC.

You have to farm for hours for a weapon that you like or is just to op, so you are obliged to use it if you don;t want to be in a disadvantage and the most times you didnt get it even if you spend many hours grinding and besides that a player thats play only few hours per weak or is new in the game, has better chances to get the gun.This is how it works the RMG in Bungie. And this how Bungie reward you for spend so many hours in the game.2. The season pass is a failure because the only think you can do is to farm bountys for XP and for power level in your artifact also for some reason endgame activities like the raid or nigtfall ordeal gives you less XP than a 10 minutes bounty farm.3.Lets talk about pvp. First of all we live in 2020 and the game still doesnt have dedicate servers for the pvp,instead you have to play in P2P servers and pray to take the host or to dont match with a hoster from another region.  Second bungie speak about skill base match making even in competitive but after three seasons all i see its low skill players get match together in the same team and high skill player in the same team,even in the competitive freelance.Is this fair.??

This is how I read this, \"We got this new version of the game thats half the game it was at its peak, and thats it. As we add new content well take away the old content, with some of it being recycled back in later\". Instead of developing what they have, they just throw out half assed content and will take it away later. There is absolutely no growth to this \"MMOs\" world.To add to it, as an \"mmo\", its just not fun to me. The character development, the grind to end game, its a small ass repetitive game thats trying too damn hard to be something its not.

It took me from the very first second. However, not every part of the game is perfect. Many features were good but got scratched (like patrol systems and factions back in D1, compared to D2Y1). The game feels still good (not as good as D1 did) but I have to say that on PC the game pace is way too high in crucible. PvE is perfectly fine but for people coming from console it can be really hard to adapt.Also the controller support has some issues since the balancing between mouse and controller is kinda... Weird.A mouse has a way higher base precision and less recoil (which results in a more effective range), it has much better sensivity settings and is easier to use of course.Controllers on the other side have a good aim assistance and thats it. No sensivity (not even close) beyond 30% of a mouse, no ADS sensivity, Controllers have more gun recoil and flinch as same as a lower base precision (resulting in a lower effective range).Controllers can compete due to the aim assistance, but not as good as a good mouse user can (due to better gun range/precision and better handling)If you come from console, and suck with M/K you will have to deal with a hard time adapting or possibly (like me) never.Besides that the changing sandbox balance will be annoying for most, as same as removed content.Crucible can be upsetting and unfair and this was the reason why I left the game after 6 years in the franchise. Mainly because of my anger in competitive.I am a part-time pvp guy in Destiny, play almost daily abit. But over the years the game made me, because of pvp, a tantrum plagued person. Before I started playing this franchise back in 2014 I was a normal kid. No anger issues, no problems.Over the years the game made me isolated, I stopped talking to real life friends, devoted my time to the game...SO, my best advise for new players is, to keep the time spent ingame on a healthy level. Otherwise you probably end like me.Destiny 2 is a very good game, but also a game with many flaws. And always new flaws appear (which is not really Bungies fault).

Cant recommend it since it lacks everything except visuals, good job Bungie, most visually appealing MMO ever hands down.TL;DR :  Play a bit, explore, see whatevers there to be seen but dont invest much time or money unless you can spend a lot more time.Bought the game on Blizzard launcher, bought Curse of Osiris and some other DLC for extra money and when it went F2P it had this \"link your accounts [to steam] now and save your progress\" or something like that, i got excited and anticipated some reward or validation atleast, logged in on day 1 to find my old character and a screen congratulating me to have successfully linked accounts and that was it. No rewards, no compensation, not even a free badge that said i paid for the game originally (i didnt grind for one either). Technically it was an upgrade for me since i got the other dlcs for free just like other players, but what about the players who actually bought everything ? They didnt get anything either. Then i bought forsaken and sadly couldnt play much either, and shadowkeep released. Again, no compensation and new players could buy shadowkeep and get access to forsakens content as well. So i bought shadowkeep, played a bit and left.Come today, almost all the content is gone from the game, and whats worse is that new players today are on the same boat as me who has been paying for content since ever. We both have the same restrictions and status, the only difference being the stuff I got from my grind which they cant get (probably) . (Btw me and my pals observed that the drop rates for items depend on the ownership of latest dlc, in that if someone had dlc they had more exotic drops and more frequent legendary drops, so thats another demerit to a f2p player).I get it that its an MMO and that it keeps evolving and obviously if we pay for some dlc and dont get all the stuff we can get from it then its our fault, BUT even MMOs leave the old content as is, they atleast dont straight up block access to the people who bought the stuff. And even if players dont play, they still recieve some reward as a symbol of purchase, even if its just a title in-game. And even if the game is partially free the old content can at-least be made available to f2p players to keep them engaged, did no one at Bungie actually think of releasing content up till shadowkeep to the f2p players ? Did it not even occur to Bungie that their game is only alive due to the f2p players on steam ?Even if they hadnt vaulted the content, it is unlikely they would have made the older content free and there is only so much f2p players can do, so why should anyone even grind for this game unless they are planning to buy the dlc smh. This makes me question, was their strategy to simply put out a demo game on steam and get everyone excited and then never actually contribute to the free tier ? Because if so, if you are a new player and wishing to decide whether you want to go into d2 or not, my only suggestion is , Dont. Unless you can actually spend 100s of hours per month to repeatedly play the same content (grind) or you get a kick from getting a poor value for money purchase, dont invest time into d2.

My preference gives me a benefit from games gunplay, bounties, quests and lore. You will find many guns, with many different alien aesthetics, and also different amount of stats and traits, even if you find the same model with the same name, it will always be unique. You will put your amount of hours into getting your perfect weapon, then find another, and compile a list of sets of loadouts you got to use on different occasions such as select raids, dungeons, strikes et cetera.If you are new to Destiny 2, and since its become Free to Play, you will have a very good start to catch up with the rest of community at endgame, you will be overflown with quests and bounties, you will be overwhelmed, however planning your first steps is always a great option to find your enjoyment.Some aspects of the game could feel repetitive such as guns and destinations, but if youve got what tells you where to go, the set of rewards provided upon completion compromises you very well in your progress to get everything you need.Campaign of the game is pretty straightforward, featuring favorable characters such as Cayde-6 and returning characters like Banshee and Zavala, you wont know much about them until you dig deeper into who they are and where they came from in quests, explorations and drops. You will stay engaged in the events of main games storyline, giving you a feel of what matters, and whats intimidating.Game looks fantastic, the amount of artistic skill put into locations, lost sectors, strike and, especially, raids, is invaluable. I only wish I played through first DLCs back then to experience it with first glance, but with further updates and fixes Bungie applies to the game, it only gets better, and I really appreciate the way I get to experience it late with so much added (Warmind would be my favorite so far in terms of visuals and style of lore).Id greatly recommend this game if you are itching for an action game that makes you do something, to grind, or just to simply gave fun with friends. It comes with many different modes that are not just explorations, featuring Gambit, a 4v4 PvP coop that sets both teams to a competition of how fast they kill a big giant boss with invasion mechanics to disrupt other teams progress on killing their boss. Crucible that puts players in teams in various PvP scenarios and sets aflame space between them, figuring out whos the most performant killer. And my favorite, is raids.

I played Destiny on Xbox, I played through D1 and played year 1 of D2, later returning when it came out on PC for Forsaken. Destiny as a whole is a captivating story with charming characters, amazing environments, and one of the most interesting universes since Star Wars, but the problem is this isnt Destiny as a whole. Destiny has a problem of being this \"evolving story\" that actually just fractures the story of the universe for players. This was an issue when D2 originally launched, the game already expected you to know the context of the world, events that happened previously, and for returning players, it worked. It was more of an expansion than a new game, which left it very drought of content early on. New players were left out of this target audience, and now it seems Bungie has doubled down on this approach with content vaulting. Deletion of Content Content Vaulting is essentially throwing content into the void promising players it might return in a few years or something. Im honestly not a fan of it. The benefit to content vaulting is of course lower storage space, but in a world where players are willing to have 200 gigabytes of their drive used up by a CoD battle royale, this really isnt an issue. Instead of vaulting content, Bungie could have made an option to uninstall portions of the game like one of the selling points of the current gen consoles; PCs of course are more than capable to do the same. Such aggressive vaulting of old fully paid for, AAA price content is terrible for new players. New players will never have the context of what happened before unless they watch a two hour lore video on YouTube, which isnt the same as experiencing the game yourself. Imagine if you could only play Halo 4 and 5 while the previous Halos were simply unobtainable. Its not a complete story.New players will never get to meet some of the communitys most beloved characters. Going into Destiny is a confusing and overwhelming experience simply because the player has no real origin. Characters reference past events that either happened in D1 or are now vaulted experiences. Whenever a new mandatory expansion comes out, the world doesnt wait for you, the story takes place without you doing anything, and previous expansions less relevant with them being marked as \"The Past\" and new, usually better equipment being added in whats new. Speaking of new expansions, lets talk about the games monetization. Monetization The game has every monetization method in the book except loot boxes. You can buy the premium currency, silver, to buy cosmetics items such as emotes, skins, etc. Every season, theres a new battle pass to buy that has in-game items unobtainable elsewhere. Its advantageous to buy it at least. With all these monetization systems, you also have the main money-maker, expansions that are essentially a mandatory buy if you want to continue playing the game which costs $40 dollars at the least with three different editions. If youre lucky, they might get vaulted in 4 years instead of 3. Bungie is certainly not short of money with all the sales and pre-orders theyre making. Verdict Its such a shame that Bungie has decided to throw so much vast world building, story, entire characters, unique locations, and game-play into the void for the sake of a smaller file size. All of this being paid for. I wish they instead took advantage of optional content download because as it stands, you are only playing 2/5ths of Destiny. It may wishful thinking but I wish they would instead go the opposite direction and port D1 into D2, so new players could experience Destiny as a complete saga instead of random pages ripped out mid-story. Theres so many moments new players can never experience from D1 (unless you want to get an old console and buy a $60 dollar unsupported game) and vaulted content from D2. D1 has all of the introductory world building while D2 has a series of half baked fetch quests as an introduction for new players. If Destiny would just piece itself back together instead of trying to constantly disassemble itself for heavier parts, it would be an amazing experience and probably one of the best, content rich MMOs of all time, yet this is far from true.

Destiny 2 the F2P, FPS and MMO-lite manages to both sustain itself as a shooter and an MMO.  By utilizing the best elements of its genres Bungie has managed to produce an engaging solo experience for your average FPS enthusiast. Furthermore, the back-end gearing system as seen in traditional MMORPGs alongside the fast-paced FPS HUD provides a uniqueness to the D2 IP that triumphs over competitors. However, the peer-to-peer connection makes fast pace and otherwise well engineered gameplay mechanics easily exploitable; bosses can be cheesed and manipulated with ease and PVP can be further exploited by simple client-side hacks. The lack of a dedicated server is therefore a real set back to this otherwise enjoyable game. On the bright side, I would argue that the business model for Destiny 2 is effective and fair. And I would advise other developers to take after Bungie, and take inspiration from their live service model. But with every business model there are of course some flaws. The last few seasons have been riddled with retextures, and have ultimately offered very little in terms of new content to the game. I would further argue that this content deficit is due to the sheer time required to create maps and environments as innovative and expansive as seen in previous Destiny 2 updates. This problem being a very common issue with ambitious MMO games, so this was to be expected- it can be hard to sustain MMOs that demand higher quality content on such a frequent basis. And unfortunately for Destiny 2, with its constant retextures and return to old content, this demand issue is starting to show. Overall, I would suggest giving this game a try and judging it for yourself; again It\u2019s not everyones cup of tea. But the game has some interesting features to offer.

TL:DR at the bottom.This is a review by a guy who has a total of almost 2,900 hours at the time of writing, cumulative from BattleNet and Steam eras. Would have definitely been a lot more if I wasnt stuck on console for several months and wasnt in school or work when (and after) Steam support was enabled.I love this game. The universe, the lore, in particular. I have the Chronicler title for a reason, and if I didnt love the game world, I wouldnt have spent even 1000 hours on it. Probably not even 500.The gameplay and current meta as-is are rapidly degrading. Does it have fun areas? Sure. Is it good fun for new players? Probably. Is it good for players that have been playing the Destiny series since vanilla Destiny 1? Most current sources say no. So, Ill give my opinions below for someone just downloading, or someone purchasing the games expansions.The free base game lacks the activities of the current seasonal structure but still has public seasonal events (such as the current guardian games). Is it fun? For a bit. The free campaign is a bit grindy at certain parts and doesnt have the best loot drops, but Id likely still have fun with it if I hadnt played it before.There are no REAL re-play-ability features in any of the campaigns, apart from strikes and crucible, but the former gets tiring quickly and the latter loses its spark from time to time. I dont remember if gambit is still free for everyone, but its in the same murky water.The paid expansions are interesting, kinda fun solo (for the most part) and definitely fun in a group. If you plan to get any, make sure you get Forsaken and/or Shadowkeep (the upgrade edition is 50 bucks, cheaper than getting both individually). I enjoyed both, and they were fun for a while. Emphasis on a while. Ill get to that later.Keep in mind that the other campaigns (red war, warmind, and curse of osiris) come first in the timeline.The other main paid feature (currently) are the Seasons. Each season comes with a different suite of content that will (currently) be phased out at the end of the season to make room for new content. This INCLUDES all matchmaking activities and triumphs attached to that particular season, as well as the seasonal badges.Sundial is a perfect example of this. If you dont know what Im talking about, google it. It comes from the most recent lapsed season.The current season is very, VERY bland and tedious. It revolves almost ENTIRELY around Bounty completions, small tasks that have no real impact on gameplay other than to mix up what you need to do with your arsenal to complete their contents. The grind takes an age if you dont have days straight to play, and ends up with very little satisfaction because of how little content there is.This is only a real issue if youve been playing the game fairly regularly. If youre new to the game and/or universe, this issue will be far less apparent, and may not even show up until the next season due to the plethora of content available for a fresh character to complete. Unfortunately, however, this content drought cycle has become a VERY strong pattern. Luckily one that does not make me pay much for it, but one that still hurts all the same.Seasons are purchasable via a season pass or individually. Im not sure if costs are the same either way, the option disappears after purchase of the current pass.Contents include the seasonal content alongside something similar to the season passes in Fortnight, Division 2, COD, etc. without being the useless cash grabs that those ones are. I actually like the system of the reward track accompanying new content rather than it being separate from that releases dlc.Are there items that encourage play? Yes. Is there a way to buy levels in the pass? Yes, but the items within the pass do not a strong character make, and purchasing levels is FULLY LOCKED until the season is almost over, rendering the possibility of pay-to-win being almost impossible.Granted, f2p content does not have a large pool of excellent weaponry, but thats been a fact since before the game went free-to play, and I dont think the difference in loot pools is nearly as significant as some people would claim. Especially with the new armor system.Theres also loot boxes, but you can earn (most of) the items in the Eververse through gameplay and bright dust bounties. Does this mean Im advocating the required completion of bounties for most cosmetics? Hell no. Im borderline \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that there STILL arent any cosmetics attainable through normal gameplay and activity completion apart from the prestige Leviathan ornaments.Now, would I recommend this game? This is very complicated, as you can probably tell from the above.For a new player with low dedication / time allocation to the universe of the game? Yes!Theres a plethora of content to enjoy out of the box, and the fact that its only 60 bucks for 3 years of content is quite the steal.To a new or returning player familiar with the lore, universe and with a lot of time on their hands to complete everything the game throws at us? Probably not. It really depends:- If you havent played D2 yet, you might get a good couple hundred hours of play time out of the box between grinding out the campaigns and hitting endgame earlier than intended. For those of you, the 60 bucks might be worth it.- For people who played vanilla and/or forsaken and/or shadowkeep? I assume you know most of the problems I mentioned above, and know to wait and see what they plan to change with their content-cycling system before you come back. I definitely wouldnt recommend a return at this point unless you want to get some friends into the game, or want to grind out the seasonal activities to see where the story is leading.TL:DR; I recommend this game with a few heavy warnings:1- If you plan on playing this game for an extended period of time, expect heavy content drought between season releases.2- If you are returning to the game, I would suggest waiting or doing research on how Bungie is changing content-cycle systems.3- If youve purchased or completed shadowkeep and/or forsaken and plan on getting the seasons, do NOT EXPECT THE SEASONS TO REFLECT THIS AMOUNT OF CONTENT. Seasonal content is often particularly gimmicky.

Then a friend got the game with the expansions, as I only had the base game, we loaded into a multiplayer match and he was levelling double the speed I was, which I thought was odd, then found out if you have the expansions, you level quicker, so fine. Thats a sly tactic but okay.I then stopped playing the first one after completing it in less than a day!Then the second one came out and I thought Ill give it a go. So I did, found it the same as the first one, just new places, better graphics and new enemies but otherwise the game played and acted the exact same, so I got bored, like all the other players which is why the player base died quickly to not much.Then months passed, the deluxe was on sale so thought Ill dive in and give it a go. When in, I got the season pass etc etc so I had all the content at my finger tips and that changed things. There was a lot more to do, lots of improvements and overall a more solid game than the first year of life.The graphics are nice and decent on the game but there is a world called Dreaming City, it is one of the final worlds you unlock and that is by far the prettiest world Ive seen in a game, the crystal, world, glowing etc effects are lovely and really nice looking, so theyve done it right graphically.Controls are super easy to get used too, but the PvP just takes time to master like any PvP mode.The game itself kinda does not have any competition, there is no direct comparison to compare this too, apart from Borderlands but again, these two games are quiet different. Yes this game has gear in which you use to increase your characters power etc, but its not to the point of Diablo aspect of gear and when you increase, it still does not feel strong.  This is why: At the start of the game, it takes a while to kill enemies, you get to max rank, go back to the start area and same applies, this is due to enemies scaling to yourself at all times so power it kinda pointless in that aspect.There are group raids which are basically dungeons, a fair amount of content with quests, raids, missions, areas, world events etc to keep you going.  This is not a pay to win game at all. You cannot buy weapons or gear from the store, its all random drops which I find is annoying. Some items you can get from an ingame store from following a set quest or guide if you like, but they are not always good weapons in my opinion and ones I want but there is a decent amount to keep you interested.There is a store to purchase the vehicles to get around and ships, but again purely cosmetic but still makes you stand out lets say.The coop is the main reason for me. Alone the game is fine but I find it gets boring super quickly. Its not a bad game and there will always be something to do and go, which is fun but there are limitations like area unlocks needed from progressing through the quest, waiting for the silly random gear drops to get something you want, which would be nice to buy but then this is stepping into the pay to win area, but I am looking on the ingame store using the ingame currency which Ive maxed out a lot because there is NOTHING worse purchasing, it used to be 100K and now it is 200K. Youll hit that quickly and then spend on useless stuff but there is often not much to buy within the game. Having a store we can purchase a full gear set with the ingame currency would be good, or boosts to increase power etc and pay money etc.There is a lot absolutely stupid grinding in this game, which I do not care about because I am not hugely invested into the Destiny World. There is a fair few people who are and quiet anal about the negative approach if you say how stupid something is, but thats an opinion we are all entitled too, like this review, but not myself and with that in mind in regards to being \"invested\"... The community is not the best either. Ive spent hours writing in chat asking people for help or info, but they barely talk or bother to reply... That sucks with this game.Would I recommend the game? Yes why not it is free to play on a game that is brilliant NOW, the game offers a lot of content for the money they are asking and is a good fun coop game with nothing else around like this.

The gun play is top notch. The graphics are good, the game sounds great.  In game its very well polished and both pvp and pve are amazingly fun. But I can no longer support Bungie and their practices of removing paid content from the game.  I paid for D2, Warmind, Curse of Osiris, Forsaken, Shadowkeep and Beyond Light. This is several hundred dollars in content and so far Bungie is removing or has removed over half of them. I can understand how Bungie want to keep the story and the narrative moving in a flowing evolving world. You dont have to delete half the game to achieve this.  Now the other excuse doesnt hold a lot of water. The games file size.  Its called optimizing they should really try it sometime.  Thats why many other games specifically other MMOs havent ballooned in size and they are able to keep day 1 content. Especially when we live in a time of expandable storage even for consoles file size begins to become less relevant.So the gameplay is great no complains. But if you want to dish out money for content be ready to have it removed at some point.  Unfortunately they have already removed some great mission, strikes, map, and exotic quests.

I figured it was about time to give them money that they absolutely deserved. But every single time I\u2019ve installed and played Destiny 2 I leave feeling the exact same way and only now understand enough to put it into words.Destiny 2 is not a AAA experience. It\u2019s a blend of mobile app daily login quests, text-wall storytelling from the 90s, artificial difficulty, and endless repetition in place of meaningful gameplay.  It makes heavy-use to addictions and a reliance on the sunken cost fallacy to keep people coming back.But despite this, I can\u2019t hate it. Destiny 2 is an Indy experience where the developer\u2019s passion and genuine attempts to make this what it deserves to be. Its terribly flawed and I can\u2019t recommend this game but I actually want to. This isnt a corporate cash grab but an attempt by creators that want to do something amazing.Where Destiny 2 shines, it\u2019s fantastic. The moment-to-moment gameplay is probably the best action MMO I\u2019ve played. It looks absolutely beautiful, it\u2019s smooth, and there are some genuinely great action sequences scattered throughout the campaigns.The Lore is one of my favorite modern sci-fi settings. It manages to blend religion, technology, old swords and new laser cannons into a world where it makes sense. It doesn\u2019t feel like a slapdash \u201cCuz its cool\u201d choce, but a genuinely well-crafted universe.  I want to read books, I want to watch TV shows, I want more of this.I think the best way to describe the negative is to showcase the difference between my early game experience and my late game one.When I arrived in the EDZ I found myself wandering around. Exploring the world for chests to upgrade, working alongside rando\u2019s to take down community bosses, exploring lost sectors. Players in this part of the world are lost and learning together.Today in Europa? Half a dozen times I had players run up, take one shot at a community event\u2026 leave and return to pick up the loot after it ended. Then I ran a strike and watched both players dash past all the enemies to speed run the mission to complete their daily bounty. Even high-level destiny players don\u2019t want to actually play high-level destiny! It\u2019s all about finding the most efficient way to complete your daily checklist to get rare drops so you can reach max level to actually do theoretically fun stuff.   I find myself praying that matchmaking fails to find a team so that I can actually listen to the plotlines and casually enjoy myself. I find myself going back to old season zones with no useful drops because no high-level players would ever go back. Destiny sucks solo, but it sucks even worse with randoms. I\u2019d be mad except that their mindset isn\u2019t wrong here. I\u2019m literally doing a quest to \u201cComplete 8 random missions\u2026\u201d so that I can unlock a quest to \u201cComplete 12 random missions\u201d\u2026 so that I can MAYBE get a weapon that is 1% better than my current one this week. It\u2019s moronic.The reality is that I\u2019ve spent ~70 hours mindlessly grinding to make my number bigger. Next season Bungie is going to reduce my attack power by 10% and tell me that grinding back to my starting point is actually content. Theres a pretty good chance Im going to do it too so that I can see the new couple story missions they add between the filler.In truth, Destiny 2 is a fine time killer, especially with friends of a similar mindset, but that\u2019s what it is. A filler game used to pass the time. When you want something satisfying youll play other games.And who knows, maybe Bungie will actually reach their potential with this game.

As hard as I try to like this game, the inherent flaws with this game take this game from what was the easiest 10/10 in my books to a 2/10 and it truly pains me to say this. As someone whos been playing since 2014, Ive stuck with the downward spiral and I think its time that I walked away from all of the nostalgia-baiting and teasing. My only original gripes at the time of release was hoping for an interesting story, what I got were like 6 strikes and new map. The Beyond Light campaign was a total joke and I felt nothing... Im Going to break my thoughts on this game into sections as I feel different about particular parts as there is no one \"Destiny Experience\" in my opinion at this point... PvE: This to me was both a highlight as much as it was a good distraction from the downs of the game. This is one of the reasons that its hard to get bored with this game and an ( in my opinion ) essential part of the experience. I have little/no complaints about the PvE in this game but: Why does light level even exist? Why remove the contents from year 1 of Destiny 2 entirely?  Destiny 2 was not free-to-play on launch and such content was paid for, why not just do something similar to the MCC PC where you can chose to uninstall a campaign or area if you dont want it but keep the essential parts in the base game such as gear?   Why does difficulty-gating almost exclusively rely on the light level system? Meaning that what was supposed to be \"difficult\" is now a walk in the ( now hive infested ) park.  PvP: This one hurts the most for me, as I remember the  MANY TWEAKS  both from D1 and D2 respectively. But the main problem with \"what is wrong with  the meta \" at this point less of a problem  not saying that it is not a problem  with the the actual meta of the game but instead the communitys focus  or lack thereof  to what makes the game itself fun to play. Its been an annoying cycle that started in the late 2017s and persists to this day.  I want this game to thrive so Im going to lay this out very simply.  On PvP - \"The Cycle\" I genuinely feel that the state of the gunplay for Destiny is in a state of total disarray and the only  true solution is a total overhaul  as currently the shifts in meta are on repeated loop that I call \"The Cycle\" and has been in a loop that has refined and repeated itself since its introduction circa Vault of Glass in D1. The Cycle for Destinys weapon sandbox is as follows  In Destiny 1   Take D1s Weapon Meta  solid shooter meta   Insert something broken  Someone finds it/uses/abuses it    A considerable amount of broken controllers later  a patch releases  Community is happy, everything seems fine for a while  Something else breaks/is introduced  Return to step 3This was okay, its okay to make mistakes/oversights. But it happened and D1 moved on and became fine-tuned over time despite its dark periods. If you need examples  Vex Mythoclast   Thorn   Pocket Infinity    Shot Package    The Last Word   Suros Regime   Matador 64   Red Death   And many more...But with time these got better acquainted to feel more competitive and less OP ( except Shot Package lol )But with Destiny 2s launch, I felt a bit of a breather. Despite there being new abilities, it felt really good at the time to stop constantly dying to ability spam tryhards. In Destiny 2   Take D2s Weapon Meta  solid shooter meta   Everything is fine  Curse of Osiris drops, the ttk is slow but generally consistent.  Warmind drops, the slow burn of a power grind begins.  With Warmind came a few broken things.  A few patches and tweaks later, something else breaks.  Most complaints are either minor or bugs but  Cycle continues until Forsaken.  Everything changes and now everyone is experimenting.  Apparently special weapons were just thrown in as specials and not tweaked.  Someone finds something broken/abuses it until it reaches critical mass  That something  looking at you OEM  is generally ignored or is an oversight and breaks the entire game balance   Game balance continues to be broken and community becomes short-sighted on single item and blames the entire perceived meta on a single item/class/weapon etc  Turns out that game still has broken parts everywhere and community has its focus on abusing/complaining about one particular thing that they do not like.   Game goes into PR mode and tries to appease fans, manages breaking game even more   Return to step 11As much as I genuinely love this game, it pains me to see the community in such a state. In my opinion \"Sunsetting\" was not a fix as I fear the cycle may only continue down a rabbit hole and eventually people will eventually get tired and leave as I have.  I dont want to be that person BUT, compare Destinys current state to ANY OTHER SHOOTER and its flaws only become more apparent.  Im not saying that every other shooter is superior and I often feel when expressing this that I need to clarify so I will do so in advance. Destiny is in a state of a short-sighted community and what appears to be a feedback team of yesmen, for the sake of the game this needs to change. PvEvP: I cant say too much about gambit as I genuinely find the game mode to consistently tons of fun. Gambit prime had a bit of an identity crisis with its roles and a bit of a balance issue with usefulness of said roles but is an easy 10/10 in my books even with its flaws. What went right As much as I hate to say it, I do love and fall for a bit of the nostalgia-bait in this game. I love the new take on the abilities and the maps/playspaces to explore around at your own will. The formula for this game is almost sandbox levels of total freedom but limited enough so that it immerses you in what I would say is well worth your time and investment.  But  What went wrong... I understand that funding a game is difficult. I have no problem with paying for expansions or buying silver for cosmetics ( especially event-related items ) as is an industry standard at this point... but... The expansions and Season-Passes in this game are disgusting and ( in my opinion ) are borderline theft. As I have spent: $100 for the base digital deluxe edition $80 for Forsaken Digital Deluxe Edition $70 for Beyond Light Delux Edition  And only the bank knows how much in silver$250 in total to see the base game assets just disappear is insulting when there are other (simpler) solutions. This should not be acceptable. On another note, I genuinely do not understand the implementation of Light/Power level in Destiny as a whole. Why punish those that do not have the time to invest into the game by restricting their access to activities. In my opinion it would be a better idea to just make unlocking the activities harder to unlock and add levels of difficulty as it was in D1 year 1. Iron banner is fun and all but the whole concept of light level simply confuses me as it gates out the more casual gamers or those who simply do not have the time.

Obviously they should have prepared but if I was leading the company, Id rather save the money and take a little heat than to lose money on empty servers.

Please also note that I have played the game and finished the storyline while the game was still on BattlenetThe game is good, the story is engaging and driving. I have not played any of the expansions and therefore cannot comment on the content they bring in. Gunplay is fun and fast, doesnt get old at all even after killing thousands upon thousands of enemies.The loot seems a little diminished, Im guessing thats because the game went free to play, meaning that Bungie needs to make money from the gameplay, not the game itself. So, the increased prices regarding the microtransactions (Any and all real money that you spend for in-game items, cosmetic or gameplay affecting) are justified in my opinion. Of course they could have given away the Forsaken dlc for free as well and made the entire \"cash shop\" essentially attainable by in-game currency but how would YOU pay for the servers and staff if that was the case? :) Anyway, Im still playing and learning more about the game, but as it stands, I definitely recommend the game.

I met a lot of cool players while kicking ass in the crucible and do not regret doing so but it makes me sad to see the current state that the game is currently in with Cheaters running rampant, 3 peekers and constant game braking bugs and glitches, not to mention the fact that we havent had a new crucible in 2 years now its about to be 3. As for PvE, all we get is recycled content and re-skinned weapons and activities. I remember when the Menagerie came out ( a PvE activity) the community LOVED it and the feedback was outstandingly positive. But due to Sun-setting weapons and content vaulting, The menagerie was removed from the game along with a good chunk of old content. Im not going to go on and bore you with the rest of the story about seasonal activities but basically Bungie gives us Menagerie like seasonal content and have been doing so for a while now and its getting old and annoying now. Anyways, Nightfalls and strikes havent rlly been changed or updated for a while now and the only saving grace of Destiny are the raids that Bungie puts out once every year and after clearing the same raid 10 times you start getting bored and annoyed and it starts to feel like a chore because of the weekly pinnacle loot that is attached to it.

It continues to improve in all of its expansions in some way shape or form. Is it worth the full asking price (all DLC)? Only if you are a hardcore fan.Is it fulfilling even a small fraction of that potential? Not in the slightest.Does it improve fast enough? Not nearly.If you want to play it for the PVP or the gunplay, you are better suited looking elsewhere. The gunplay is only incredible by 2013 standards (its just average today), and the PVP while fun is an absolute cheese fest that doesnt respect player skill (universal calls for nerfs to a broken exotic are ignored, something unrelated is nerfed is a common occurence). Developer has a bad habit of adding content that is time limited and/or making all of previous content useless, wasting dev time on something that wont even contribute to the future of the game and player time on grinding. For example, Armor 2.0 was said to be supposed to increase flexibility of builds, but all that I found it did was make every armor piece (exotic included) that I had before completely inferior stat wise, forcing me to re-grind almost everything. Solstice armor is the worst of this, because each time it was available, it was a massive grind to the best armor set in the game only to be immediately useless after the next major expansion.If you dont care about the story/lore the game is going to have a significantly lower value proposition.Also never, ever, give Bungie any slack. The moment they think all is peachy and they can relax, they let the game go to complete \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and fast. After a couple expansions people are going to realize that many of Bungies failings arent from Activision (though being free of that plague definitely helps).I know this review sounds negative, but I still recommend playing this game for some of the experiences it nets you. My recommendation is to wait for the DLC to go on sale, and buy it all in a bundle so as to reduce the total costs (assuming you want it all).Additional Note: Steam hours are inaccurate. Ive gone through most of the games pre-shadowkeep content with three separate characters (one for each class). Hour-wise I know 100% I am in the hundreds, if not a thousand.TLDR: Destiny 2 is good, but not so good you should buy at full price or pre-order. If you do, you will be left with a strange mix of buyers remorse from the game not being what it should be and genuine enjoyment from the game anyway.UPDATE: Destiny 2 is going through a downward spiral. Consider this review still effective, but with lower highs and even lower lows. Destiny seems to go out of its way to build gameplay loops that burn you out, and that doesnt help.UPDATE 2: Beyond Light was released. Cool new lore stuff, but this expansion somehow REDUCED the amount of available loot in the game and didnt add all that much new stuff. Deeper down the downward spiral. Ill probably still buy it because I want to experience the lore moments in person, but Im a sucker and you shouldnt be.", "Author": "Ballistic Wizard", "Hours": 384.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: April 30, 2021", "Review": " Preface This review is separated into two parts, The Game Itself and The Company Behind The Game. I believe these are separate aspects a consumer needs to consider when deciding if a game is worth their time. Overall, I feel Destiny 2 is worth playing because the content within the game itself is highly rewarding, the community (from the perspective of a mainly PvE player) is helpful and inclusive, and the gunplay is top-tier. However, the practices of Bungie stain the reputation of what could be one of the best franchises in gaming and that cannot be overlooked. The Game Itself Destiny 2s gameplay revolves around the power system. The power system dictates how strong your character is relative to the content youre up against. Because of this, Destiny 2s core gameplay loop is highly addictive to someone who enjoys RPG-style rewards systems. Lower end content like patrols and public events drop gear like blue items and sometimes purples which help to boost a new players power level to the \"soft cap\" (which at the time of this writing is 1250). Then, you use the gear you got from the lower end content to complete higher end content like Nightfalls and Raids, and you use the powerful gear you receive from those activities to tackle endgame content like Grandmaster Nightfalls. The latest major expansion, Beyond Light, adds content on the planet of Europa including a 8-10 hour campaign (for me, you may be able to complete it faster), and tons of side content like aspect/fragment hunting, collectibles like penguin toys and dead exos, Empire Hunts, and the main attraction, the Deep Stone Crypt Raid. The expansion also adds Stasis subclasses which have completely changed the meta in the Crucible, and are highly utilized in endgame content when paired with the seasonal mod Focusing Lens which buffs light ability damage to targets affected by stasis. While others may say the content in Beyond Light doesnt justify the price tag, after playing through it on all three characters to unlock their respective subclasses and collecting all the penguin toys and dead exos, I can say that Ive gotten my moneys worth, and Im nowhere near done with my time in Europa. Theres still tons I need to do there. In my opinion, Beyond Light is worth buying if youre looking to get an expansion for the game.  Ive played through the legacy expansions Forsaken and Shadowkeep, and while their stories are enjoyable, the main reason for buying those past expansions is to acquire the exotic guns associated with them from the monument of lost lights. The actual content that resided within those expansions, excluding the raids, is rarely played anymore.When it comes to the seasonal content, Ive only started playing the game at the beginning of Season 13, so that is what I can speak on. Ive completed the triumph seal for Season of the Chosen and obtained the Chosen title, so theres my gamer credentials to back up my opinion. The seasonal story mission Presage is highly atmospheric and the reward for completing it, The Dead Mans Tale scout rifle, is one of the meta weapons in PvP going into Season 14. Besides that, the exotic weapon Ticuus Divination is an excellent PvE ad-clear weapon which can be earned on the free track of the pass at Rank 35. The seasonal armor ornaments for Season 13 (in my opinion) looks ugly for each character and arent worth buying the pass for. The Battlegrounds playlist activity, while fun, does not reward a pinnacle gear drop and thus isnt worth playing extensively unless you want to focus farm the seasons legendary weapons. On that point, this seasons SMG Extraodinary Rendition is considered by many players to be an S-tier gun, but I rarely ever use it over other available options. Personally, Id only recommend buying the season pass if youre a dedicated PvP player and really want Dead Mans Tale for your arsenal.  The Company Behind The Game Ive only played two Bungie games: Halo Combat Evolved and Destiny 2. I played Halo Combat Evolved in high school with my friends and we always had a blast, it really was a bonding experience for us. Wed trade a downloadable copy on a USB drive and play it on the computers when we were supposed to be working. Bungies games are the producers of some of my favorite high school memories, which is why its saddening to watch them go down this road. If youre unaware, Bungie recently announced a convoluted and limiting transmogrification system which treats their paying players like a free to play game would treat theirs. Destiny 2 is not a free to play game; it is a free to try game. To get the most of the experience, you need to pay for at least one expansion, otherwise the extent of the content you can play through is the Crucible, Gambit, and Strike playlist. Bungie needs to stop using the moniker of a \"free to play\" title as a defense for their anti-consumer business practices. The more and more time I spend within this game, the more and more I notice the flaws that lie beneath the surface, When it takes Bungie months to fix a problem as simple as a chest missing from a location when it should be there, it makes you wonder where your money is actually going. I love Destiny 2, and I will keep playing it through Season 14 and the newer expansions, but the longer Bungie walks down this road, the harder it becomes to recommend their game to new players.  Conclusion At current, I would recommend that you play Destiny 2. I think the game itself is very enjoyable. If you have friends to play it with, thats excellent. If not, you can look up the Destiny 2 PC LFG Discord and other Looking For Group servers to find people to play with, or you can add me and we can play some stuff together :) The community is very welcoming and supportive so it shouldnt be too hard to find a clan or some people to play the content of the game with. However, Id also recommend you to be wary of Bungies business practices and make sure to speak up when they do something that goes too far.", "Author": "StarrySinner", "Hours": 541.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "Quite a lot to do even for a free-to-play player.", "Author": "Piotrek, Engineer of Design", "Hours": 2615.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: January 12, 2021", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "Blackcat", "Hours": 6.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: May 12, 2021", "Review": "Imagine paying for a full game + DLC that in total amounts to the price of a AAA game.

Then I wore out on the content that was available and stepped away for awhile.  Trying to come back has been a nightmare.  I played for a few days to grind up my level.  Boy was that a waste of time. I logged in today and found a multitude of problems: my level was randomly higher (but somehow I was underpowered for missions I played before), I was dropped into some random mission, and multiple missions and locations I had paid for were removed from the game.  That was really the last straw.  I bought this game for a family member awhile back, and now the content that I bought for them is gone.  Apparently this game is only for people who are willing to spend $100 bucks a year to buy it over and over and over.  Its one thing to *ADD* content and ask people to pay for it.  Its another to remove content someone already paid for.  Im sure they wrote somewhere into a licensing agreement they knew nobody would read that its okay for them to do that.  Hope that makes them feel nice and good about themselves.  The videogame industry is no stranger to disgusting practices. Loot boxes come to mind. But this really tops it.  So, long story short, Destiny 2 was fun back when it was what I paid for.  But now what I paid for is gone.

I was mostly doing some story missions, collecting stuff for exotic weapons, and sometimes did some PVP or open world events.How I score the game after the Beyond Light? - Very NegativeI lost all my weapons and can keep using only a few that dropped to me in September, and a few exotics that I managed to gather, but upgrading them cost expensive mats, and you can only wield 1 exotic in your character weapons slots.I just finished the Forsaken story, and was ready for the quest for Caydes gun...then I found out it was removed and the only way to get it is to farm 100 rare items that make me have to repeat daily bounties from gunsmith for several weeks, or with my cadence of playing, months. There was like 30+ quests that I had in progress in my quest log and now they are gone.PVP is broken due to the new subclasses, I dont even want to try it.I have nothing to do on Europa, because I didnt pay for it.I have nothing to do in the season, because I didnt pay for it. If I buy the new DLC, it will get removed in a few years. The added Cosmodrome is the exact same place as in Destiny 1, which I already played for like 200 hours and I dont need to play it again in Destiny 2. Especially since I dont have any missions there.I was a paying customer, now after the Beyond Light, I feel like Im a free to play player and all my previous purchases expired.Bungie, this was the worst and stupidest decision you ever did. There are many casual players who enjoyed this game as a single player(read offline) experience, and you effectively took our game away and gave us 50 euro option to have one new planet. I will never come back. Enjoy your downfall.Bonus critique: * Before the update, the game ran with my RTX 3080 with 100 FPS locked on 4K resolution and maxed out setting. After your update, I get 80 FPS dropping down 60-70. I had to lock my FPS to 60 to have it stable* I dont know how you managed this, but Destiny 2 PC basically doesnt have any anti-aliasing in the game. On 4K ultra, the game has very ugly and noticeable rough texture lines, especially on objects like thin cables and fences, and space ships on the loading screen. It cannot be removed with any setting in game or in the GPU driver. It is just impossible. It can get better by super-sampling, but it doesnt fix it completely, and if you run the game on 4K you cannot super-sample with good FPS anyway. On consoles, the game has nice smooth lines, no aliasing issues. On PC... it is like you didnt even care to fix it.* I dont know how this is possible but it seems like the game has screen tearing when you have FPS above 60. My LG OLED runs at 120 Hz, and with 100 FPS locked (before the update) I noticed the screen tearing on walls, basically on all close textures on the sides of the display. When I locked the FPS  to 60, it was gone. I dont think it is because of my TV, since other games that I ran at 120 FPS didnt have any screen tearing at all.", "Author": "Alis", "Hours": 77.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 24, 2021", "Review": "Honest thoughts on this game after it being my main grind over 3 years. Destiny is a game that I love dearly but is hard to recommend to others. It requires a lot of repetitive grind to get to the substantial end game and once you get to that content theres an additional hurdle that requires you to then manually find people to join you since Bungie does not trust people matchmaking with anything more complex than a strike. There are also no in-game ways to quickly form raid groups or groups for end game content like dungeons or GrandMaster Nighfalls. The majority of the community relies on the website based LFG tool or several discord communites dedicated to LFG. In addition to this, with the current state the game is in, it is hard to get onboarded as a new player since the original vanilla campaign is gone along with a large swathe of content. Although the content removal has helped Bungie overall by changing the timeline of balance patches to change from waiting months to weeks, it is still a major pain point. All of the core playlists Strikes, Gambit, and Crucible are also in a sorry state due to the major content vaulting and it can get very repetitive and boring since Bungie expects you to constantly engage with them in order to make any meaningful progress with your power level grind. I will note though Bungie has been taking steps to try and address this, but only the future will tell if they actually follow through. As of right now, outlook not so good. The reason I keep playing however, is that the end game experience of Destiny is extremely satisfying for me. The raids, although not as complex as more traditional MMOs like FFXIV/WoW are thematically strong and have engaging mechanics throughout. I love how everyone contributes to raid damage in meaningful ways and the most recent raids have had great loot pools to keep coming back to grind. Each raid, as of right now, also have different optimal dps metas, which are satisfying to figure out and execute while also rewarding you for having extensive knowledge on the encounters and what loadouts to bring for each of them. There is also a huge level of enjoyment I get from teaching new raiders and bringing them to that next level of the game. If you also put the time in to learn all of the complexities of this game as well, with its weapon perk pools, exotic combinations, and armor mod system youll find a fun and in-depth RPG system analogous to a TCG deckbuilder. I find it fun just messing around with different builds for the various activities in the game and finding just the right ones to bring for endgame or meme/gimmicky ones for lower difficulty activities. However all of this fun is conditional (which seems to be a running theme with this game) and comes with a huge caveat. Not many people even engage with the endgame content in the game. (only 7% of the steam community has done The Last Wish raid and when Leviathan was in the game only around 12% of the community has the associated achievement) So unless you find yourself with a dedicated raid group or are lucky to find a sherpa willing to guide you through it you probably wont be even seeing this content due to the aforementioned reason of no matchmaking for these activities or in-game way to organize groups. This is an unfortunate reality of the game that hasnt been addressed since its creation and I think is a byproduct of Bungie trying to shift the direction and focus of this game from a FPS looter shooter into an MMORPG. It does the FPS core loop extremely well but falls far behind its MMORPG contemporaries in regards to social tools needed to engage with the endgame activities/With all of this being said, I love Destiny and will probably continue playing this game for years to come. Its a beast of a game to learn, while also needing to engage in an honestly repetitive grind, but for me the gunplay, RPG mechanics, and satisfying endgame loop Bungie has put into place are something unmmatched in the current gaming space and I will always be coming back to this game.", "Author": "Domjani, the Greathearted", "Hours": 2194.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "For the price of absolutely nothing, you have no reason not to try out Destiny 2.

To anyone starting fresh as a new light player I would highly recommend taking a deep breath, Be patient, But most of all focus on one thing at a time, Because when you make it through the introduction it is up to you to decide where to head and what to do.The lore is rich, but you have to go hunting for it as it would be impossible to give the lore just in the campaign as some games do. The variety of weapons can be daunting at times, but find what suits you dont assume or blindly trust reviewers when it comes to weapons as some weapons have hidden perks or mechanics that lead to fun play styles or support roles. Weapon perks can do everything from how a weapon handles, reload speed, and damages overall although some perks will stand out above others such as feeding frenzy, rampage, kill clip, etc. to name a few but realistically it can be a very long grind R N G wise to get that role you want it may take you thousands of hours or you can be lucky and get it first time  (insert bragging rights here).PvP in regards to Crucible and Gambit you either love it or loath it but take the time to learn how the game modes work as holding control points or helping someone kill a blocker could make or break winning a match. Bounties from vendors some are very basic to complete and others are not worth the time it is best to pick and choose what you think can be done fast as you can easily get side tracked by them. Classes are Hunter, Titan and Warlock each can be fun in its own right but it will most likely the jump mechanic which your most enjoyed/ main class will end up being.Elements are broken into 3 classes with 3 sub classes each they all have a unique play styles usually revolving around melee, ranged and support, even the support specs are still damage roles so rest assured if your tired from games where you just have to tank or heal you will notice the difference.In the end it takes at least 30-40 hrs of game play to see the game properly, but i will say remember to stop and take in the view.", "Author": "Amoksuun", "Hours": 5314.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: August 29, 2021", "Review": "Very good game, but dont expect much from the free 2 play, its pr much a demo.", "Author": "Valkyrie, Kell of Lesbians", "Hours": 784.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: August 26, 2021", "Review": "I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hate this game.

It has had 2 iterations (were on D2) and over each ones lifespan (about 3 years) theyve had a similar pattern: -Mediocre at best launch, either no story or no endgame-Major Expansion #1 which fixes MOST of the glaring issues to the game-Major Expansion #2 which is smaller but improves on the best parts of the gameAs a Free to Play title, you get all of the Launch content, and the 2 minor expansions that came in year 1, along with the post launch content from Major Expansion 1 (Forsaken), which isnt a bad set of content, as well as all of the new maps, which are all great.  The Story isnt as phenomenal and the endgame feels somewhat limited but you can definitely still play, from what Ive heard the game doesnt really hold your hand if youre a new player now that its free to play and they changed the entry point, but I cant really say much on that, again, experienced player here.  Its absolutely worth a try if you havent played it before, and as always, bungie has the gunplay DOWN, so at least shooting aliens is more fun than ever.Forsaken: This is the bulk of the game from last year, and its got very mechanic heavy endgame content and arguably the best story in all of destiny so far, that being said, youre really only paying for the endgame activity, the raid, and the story here, so unless youre into that (i still recommend it) it may not be worth buying immediately.Shadowkeep: This is all the big relevant stuff is here.  The story is massively deep and spooky as all hell but it is rather short and a bit abrupt, what is big here is the endgame content, there is a MASSIVE roadmap of stuff to do that is coming out almost weekly over the next year, with new seasonal content dropping regularly, the endgame raid in this is phenomenal too, and for those who played Destiny 1, youll love the location the raid drops you into.Overall: This game has been my pride and joy for the past 5 years, Ive got at least 1k hours in both Destiny 1 and 2 each, Ive played the game through its ups and downs, and seeing bungie topple the megalomaniac that was Activision and go out on their own for this game was a sight to behold.

The fact Destiny can be one of the most viewed games during a content drop, to near the bottom of the barrel a week later shows the insane potential this game has. I cant recommend Destiny more than I already have, but it comes with all these warnings and more. Solo have always been ignored only until recently which Is still a issue for those players, but they are actively trying to provide more for those players which is a plus.

This is incredibly annoying, cause i dont wanna do 90% of the things the bounties demand. I really wish i could just do whatever i want, and be equally rewarded for it as if i had done specific forced things. (Doing these also seem to be the only way you can really properly progress after power level 905). And forcing me to do all these quests and bounties over and over and over, have made me completely hate these activities, whilst i would probably have enjoyed them if i wasnt forced to play them. (F**k the reckoning... so much.)- Quest overload: The quests are pretty much the same as the bounties, just with some very shallow story to it. Most of it basically follow this format:Quest Giver: Theres no way you can do thisDrone friendo: Oh he can do it*You do the thing*Quest Giver: omg youre the most amazing person everDrone friendo: told you.It just feels like another layer to waste my time, and force me to do stuff i dont wanna do in an open world MMORPG. Why not just do a more free form of gameplay? and i dont know how i feel about this \"self confidence gained through games\" sort of thing, i dont think its gonna translate to a healthy life, more so just increase the likelihood of a gaming addiction to escape real life inadequacy.- Lack of proper introduction to everything the game has to offer, its Warframe levels of confusing. There really needs to be some sort of simpler menu than the Destinations menu, that just lists the activities and the different sorts within them.- The inventory management: What do i keep? what is a good roll? whats the best weapons? these are the inevitable questions with MMORPGs, cause either you play the best gear or you lose. And since the game forces you to pick things to keep, since you quickly get too much loot, you have to figure these things out very fast.- The bait and switch: You start out progressing fast, and then suddenly it comes to a screeching halt, and progressing the game becomes super slow. I think it took me a day or two to get from power level 750 to power level 900, and a week to get from level 900 to level 910. I hate this type of mind game, its manipulative and disgusting.- Lootboxes.- The monotone nature of the game: it really just feels so tame and boring, im not sure why, but the game just doesnt excite me at all really? maybe its the pve bullet sponge gameplay, or the lack of technique to winning pvp, but i just dont feel much in it. I think the only time i really felt excitement about the game was when i played Gambit, and always tried to get a large blocker sent everytime i delivered. It was a high risk, high reward situation, but the invasions are almost always bullsh*t and unfair. The guns are okay, none of them really do anything crazy like Borderlands guns, just kinda feels like i get the same gun with a different skin half the time.- Lack of gear matchmaking: From the very start ive been put up against players with way better gear than me, lvl 970 against me at 920. 930+ players constantly back when i just started at 750. I have no idea why they would put new players up against the veterans, but it ruins so much of the PvP when you get 1 shotted constantly.- Punishing the noobs: If you do poorly in PvP, you will get 0 rewards. You might aswell not have played at all, cause that time was wasted progress wise.- Several of the best weapons are hidden behind ranked PvP, so you pretty much HAVE to play ranked PvP.- You have to go through loading screens for each area with the bounties you need, and then go back to another loading screen for the actual activity you do the bounties in repeatedly.- Why is there storage limits for EVERYTHING, even colors for your items?!- Overall it just seem like the usual monotone MMORPG gameplay, that is severely hindered by PVE mixed with PVP balancing, and balancing the limits of Massive multiplayer games with exciting gameplay.

This game is also a really bad one though.First off: Visuals are stunning!Its quite rare to find game worlds so well crafted and thought (just look at some Nessus or Dreaming City images).Secondly: The game is actually Free to Play apart the DLC that imped you from obtaining some rare equipments and missions. All the money you can throw at the game wont make you a overpowered player...only a more fashonable one since all you can buy are emotes, color palettes and skins for armors and weapons. Yes, you CAN toss 10 euros to get a Season pass, thing that I personally suggest to do since it actually makes you just farm MUCH less and gives you a LITTLE edge in the season (120 days more or less) like a wooping 30%exp boost, signature exotic weapon at level 1 instead than at level 30...unique skins, some resources easy to farm...thats it. Other than that, the game is a semi classic fps with some unique mechanics having a peculiar power per class (dodge for hunters, barricade for Titans and a healing/damage boosting circle for Warlocks), grenades and melee attaks all with a cooldown timer that can be shortened with the right gear.Each class has 3 elemental subclasses each witn 3 \"attunements\" that are no other than sub-subclasses. I you play hunter on Solar class is going to be VERY different from plaiyng it with the Void class and so on...Mainly though you try em all out and just stick with the one that makes you die less times in a row.And yes, you WILL die...A LOT. It is the main thing of the game. Guardians (you) are common being that has been chosen to be resurrected every time they die to just keep on fighting. This doesnt make you a super hard tank even if you build to be one...if a sniper hits you, 2 or 3 hits and youre dead. And most of the time if there is a sniper, stay sure there are 8 more with other 20 minions and a big guy all with a solid aimbot that if its targeting you it WILL hit you, no matter what maneuver youll do. Hurray!The game is really fun once you get the hang of it. You start to know the various enemy types (5 races in total), how they work, how they kill you and most of the time you are focused on shooting something big you die killed by the minion that managed a ridiculously damaging claw attak.The game structure is quite confusing at first since it lets you do whatever since the beginning, litterally FLOODING you with quests to do and no order in how or when to do them. but there is one thing that will always pop out...and it will haunt you in your dreams...the ONLY reason I quitted this game: CRUCIBLE.\"Hate them or BE one of them\"Crucible is the PvP part of the game. A series of mostly common PvP activities (capture, deathmatch...) done in a completely messed up and unbalanced way.Titans rule here...with evident and absolutly unfair reasons.They have: More hp                   More Shields                   Better survivability equipments and abilities                   Mostly 1-hit kills melee attaksIts not uncommon to find an enemy, starting to shoot him and barely kill him with your hp at 5%...but you won :DIts even less uncommon to find yourself in front of a titan where you start shooting...you hit him 3 times. He turns, runs to you while you shoot 3 more shots in his thick skull, and he just shoulder dash you killing you in a single hit. The death-cam then opens up showing how much hp he still had...he is already regenerating the shields and had 70% wich are regenerating as well.Other than that Many weapons are litterally broken since can almost one-hit kill many players even with the ultimate power active, thing that usually makes you almost unkillable...unless the one youre facing has one of these few weapons.So...just dont play crucible if you dont like it or, as me, youre also not good at it. Gladly...if only most of the quests in this game litterally REQUIRES you to play PvP. And in precise ways as well.Let me tell you about the 2 reasons that made me quit this game, I know this review is already quite long but, bare with me a little more:A really nice single slug shotgun exotic is a reward for clearing a quest that states \"Reset your Valor rank\".Now \"Valor\" is a score you get passively plaiyng Crucible. You get something around 50 for losing a match and 100 for winning it with a multiplier that goes up to x5 for consecutive victory and decreases when you loose. Now to Reset you have to get to maximum Valor...that is around 5k if Im not mistaken. A hefty mission but not at all impossible (I managed to reset my valor 3 times in 2 months barely plaiyng crucible). I stupidly thought to get the shotgun after the reset...instead the mission changes and now tells me to get 25 shotgun kills in crucible...ok its quite easy, given the right distance almost any shotgun is an instant kill. After that...the depression...\"Get 100 solar, 100 void and 100 arc kills in crucible but beware that every lost match sets you back by 1% from each\"Now if you play the absolute star of the match, wreaking havok on the enemy team getting 3 or 4 kills per life...youll arrive around 30-34 kills in a common match.But the mission choices are: Deathmatch 6v6, Control 3 points in 2 squads 6v6 or Survival that is almost out of question since its a 3v3 squad base where each squad has 6 total lifes.Dont forget also how Crucible works for classes, eh? So, for me this quest is almost impossible...AND I dont want to even try it.Moving on, one of my favourite weapons, the Ace of Spades Hand cannon...not only you have to complete the Forsaken Campaign (after buying it) you have to kill first 500 enemies in gambit with hand cannons...ok, easy. Then kill 250 enemies in Strikes...ok, easy. Then get 25 precision headshot kills in the Crucible with Hand Cannons.After this one I exited the game and disinstalled it.If you made it this far, big ouff and thanks for reading. If you just skipped to this point...I can imagine why.Anyway:Do I like this game? Yes, A LOT.Do I hate it? Yes...A LOT.Do I suggest you to get it? Sure, why not? It IS free after all and what made me quit from pure rage might not kill your mood to play it so I actually DO suggest you to play it...but be aware of what I wrote.", "Author": "Bardiele", "Hours": 1949.3}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 17, 2020", "Review": "I cant talk about paid players but I can talk about as a f2p player who got the game back on Battle.netRight now, its the worst time possible for a f2p player to be in, they got rid of all the content that was in the base game with the exception of Nessus, the Earth and the Tower, there are no raids available for f2p players, half the exotics are gone, you can only do Strikes, Crucible (and it sucks) and Gambit and the three of them are missing half of the map pool and obviously the Public Events.Also, many of the weapons and armor that you had before Shadowkeep are now useless because they cant be leveled up with a system called \"Sunsetting\" and you MUST grind new equipment to be relevant, say goodbye to your favorite Shotgun, Sniper, whatever, it no longer works (yes, even if you paid for those expansions, fortunately it doesnt affect exotics).But hey, they re-introduced a zone from Destiny 1 in which you cant do anything and it is reused content from D1.If youve been playing as a f2p player then this update really affects you negatively and youre very limited to the activities that you can do (even if you paid for the others expansions it affects you).Now the game calls itself MMO, well if we compare D2 with the other mmos (and you know which ones) then it comes out REALLY short.And to think that this guys made the og Halo trilogy +Reach and ODST...TLDR: As a F2P you are grinding for an endgame that doesnt exist for you.As a paid user, they just robbed you the content that you paid for before.Ill keep updating if I see something worth talking about, also Ive enabled the comments (dont know why they where deactivated) if you want to say something,First of all, I did not watch the Walking Dead TV series or read the comic books. So I bought this game without any expectation. Once I completely finished the whole game, I was blown away. The story line was near perfect.However, I would like to add that the Point and Click genre of this game is a bit rudimentary. The reason being, most (not all) of the choices a player makes does not really change the whole story line. This brings up another question. I hate to say this but in our current computer programming technology, the Point and Click genre is at its infancy. Perhaps in 10 or 20 years time, this genre will evolve into maturity and the story lines of this genre will be near diverse in nature.Perhaps in the future, our children and grandchildren might laugh at this game for being too rudimentary by the choices a player makes in the game. We shall see but currently, considering the limitation of computer programming, this is a great game though. However try to buy it when it is on sale.

Bungie will mess up, and then they will show up. They know how to make a good game. Whether it be the beautiful skyboxes, the fierce battle between your fireteam and a raid boss, or the adrenaline rush when you clutch a 1v3 in the crucible, there are always amazing moments to have.Bungies franchise is by no means perfect, but I in no way can say it isnt enjoyable.The story is unique and it shows they spent a good amount of time planning it out. The immersive experience in the base story was amazing, meeting new characters and reconnecting with old ones is amazing. We get to watch these characters develop and adapt to the troubles they face. I dont want to spoil the story for new player, so I will leave it at this, the story is something you wont want to miss.Once all of the story is out of the way, the path towards endgame begins. There is so much to chase in the world of Destiny that there is never nothing to do. It may be tedious farming for the same weapon over and over, but it is SO rewarding when you finally get that god roll weapon you have been farming hours for.You dont want to chase a weapon? Dont worry, there is so much more you can do! You and a fireteam of three could head into the Trials of Osiris, battling to reach the end to open up that chest in the lighthouse after defeating 7 other fireteams in a row.You dont like crucible? Dont worry, there is something for you too! Going into the depths of the dungeons with two other guardians, you will face difficulty straight in the face and you will come out victorious. Whether it be in the mysterious Dreaming City, or the evil caverns of the Moon. It is an experience to enjoy! The best feeling, is going into the depths of the Pit of Heresy, and coming out victorious after defeating every enemy as a one guardian army.There is something for everyone. And trust me, the game may be one hell of a roller coaster sometimes, but it will always be here. If you dont enjoy the game at some point, take that break from Destiny that you think you need. The game will be here when you feel like it is worth it to play. Dont force yourself to play something you dont enjoy.Gaming is something you should look forward to.

This game was my entire life for about 3 years but unfortunately there has been many changes i heavily disagreed with enough to quit, but its NOT completely unplayable by any means.My personal reasons i cannot recommend anymore:They have actively removed MULTIPLE expansions of DLC that I and many others fully paid for before they were made free. Apparently just to make the game easier to code and add onto, this must be the most spaghetti code game ever according to them.The vanity and transmog system was horrible on release, multiple time gates and limitations.. just to look cool in an \"\"\"MMO\"\"\" btw. They have reverted some of the time gating though its still not great, not to mention how many other games do this well.The style and overall quality of content has gone down CONSIDERABLY the past few years, which is subjective and many people still enjoy it but the \"battle pass seasons\" style of dlc just isnt for me. Not to mention the seasons are all removed at the end of the year with the next expansion.The story is absolutely ALL OVER THE PLACE. Since the majority of campaigns and story has been since removed, things are so disjointed i have NO idea where a new player would start besides a youtube video. The storytelling and lore itself is okay, but so much has been removed its hard to have context or care about anything unless youre a vet.Though Destiny 2 is not an entirely bad game, theres many things that i fell in love with and are (fortunately) still in the game:The gunplay is one of my favorite from any fps game personally, (most) guns feel unique and good to use, highly customized with perk rolls that usually change up your play style. Theres only a few guns i can think of that i didnt enjoy using. Abilities are also just as fun to use as the guns, every class and every subclass is enjoyable, especially when you get into theory-crafting and making builds with a plethora of armor mods.The soundtrack is pretty good in my opinion, some tracks can make you feel wonder, others are jam-packed and ready for action when it comes. Personally i just really like the calm and orchestration music like in orbit or on certain planets, which captures the feel of the game well. In particular some raids have very good soundtracks..Now ill talk about raiding. Raiding in destiny 2 is something i have yet to find in any other fps, (most) of them were taken out of the game, yet the few that remain are all extremely enjoyable. Groups of 6 with mechanics combined with fps game play almost perfectly in my opinion, not to mention some of the set pieces and gear you can get from them are pretty cool. Though again, most of them have been removed with the previous expansions.Lastly, the lore and universe in Destiny has always been pretty great to me. I always loved sci-fi + fantasy Space Magic, and Destiny does it well. If you take the time to read into it, theres pages upon pages of lore books all detailing this universe Bungie has created. Though, yet again, most of the campaigns and items with this lore has been removed.All in all Destiny 2 is complicated, i dont think it will be for everyone but there is definitely a place for the game as many people still enjoy it. Though with the recent decisions with the devs and quality of content that have drove away me and many others, I cannot recommend the game in its current state as a long time Destiny fan.", "Author": "Kimmy the Wolf~ \u2665", "Hours": 2766.6}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: June 7, 2020", "Review": "\u68d2\u9e21\u7c89\u8f6c\u8def\u8f6c\u9ed1\u4e00\u6761\u9f99\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u9519\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u5f53\u521d\u9884\u5b9a\u5e741\u8c6a\u534e\u7248\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u50bb\u903c", "Author": "Kaiju", "Hours": 581.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 14, 2020", "Review": "This is my favorite game, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.", "Author": "Fardy Hoopenaggle", "Hours": 964.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 12, 2019", "Review": "it good", "Author": "WordSlice", "Hours": 2.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 6, 2019", "Review": "Its Destiny and its free.

Play it if you want. Come and play for the raids, story, and to experience the gold standard for gunplay. Skip this one if you do not enjoy live service games/MMOs, or are looking for a new PvP game to play.*Heres my thoughts:General: The gunplay is the best in any game that I have ever had the pleasure in playing. Most guns are amazingly satisfying to fire. The loot is great, with harder activities making you more and more powerful, although the item level grind is getting mundane, let alone inconsequential at this point. Exotic weapons and armour (exotic is the rarity above legendary) are, for the most part, an absolute blast to use, with all of them being unique from one another. The art and music in this game are phenomenal. The locations are extremely memorable, but the music is less so most of the time, because it all can just sound like *space orchestra noises.* Dont get me wrong, there are some absolute stand-out tracks, but they are few and far between.The DLC feels more and more mandatory as time goes on as the base game is relatively lacking in content, but the fear of what Bungie calls \"vaulting\" should keep you cautious: YOU DO NOT \"OWN\" THE DLC, and Bungie has been removing content inside the game for various technical reasons. They removed the Forsaken campaign and the Tangled Shore destination this year. This game is costly to keep up with (yearly expansions and a battle pass with no subscription cost so its overall not as expensive as your usual MMO), and you WILL lose access to DLC eventually unless something changes down the line. For instance, if you purchase The Witch Queen now, you will likely not be able to play the Campaign or explore the area after 2024.PvE: Campaign is now an absolute stand-out part of Destiny 2. Enemy AI is fine, if a little broken at times, and the difficulty can range from an absolute joke to extremely difficult, even at endgame. Raids are one of the \"pinnacle\" activities, and they are by far the most fun activity to do in the game. The story is being splayed out over a long period of time now, mostly in the form of weekly missions, with a new story arc every 3 months. Bungie is beginning to find their footing in regards to story.Dungeons and exotic quests are the best low-man or solo content inside of PvE, and Grandmaster Nightfalls are a good source of loot for the difficulty they pose.PvP: Apparently theres some dedicated server communication going on, though it feels like it is just your usual peer to peer servers. The matchmaking changes made in December 2021 are... interesting to say the least. You will most likely not enjoy your first Crucible match. The time to kill is relatively slow, 0.5-1s, but there is *always* an annoying and prominent meta that can and will stop you from doing PvP builds that you enjoy from time to time. Its fairly rewarding, but it may not be worth the time to learn until Arc and Solar 3.0 get released to balance out the abilities.There are private matches. They work fine, but it would be nice to have some more options in the future.COMPETITIVE IS VERY, *VERY* LOW PRIORITY FOR BUNGIE. THIS IS NOT A COMPETITIVE GAME BY ANY MEANS. There is a ranking system of sorts, but it is extremely poorly held together with no real extrinsic value outside of a title and a quick source of loot once per season.PvEvP (Gambit): It sucks. Bungie managed to take PvE and make it less fun, and add the worst parts of PvP on top. Always a meta weapon or super that makes invading and being invaded un-fun, and a pre-made team is almost always needed to win. The mode allows for snowballing and gives little to no room for comebacks. The changes in The Witch Queen made Gambit worse.Community: This community is massive. If you need to get some people for an activity (3 or 6 is usually the fireteam size) check the \"find fireteam\" function on bungie.net, or join the PC LFG Destiny 2 discord server. There is no party finder functionality in-game. NEVER pay someone to help you with something. Someone will be willing to help you do stuff for fun, no matter the time or the activity.

It certainly was a former shell of Destiny 1.But then, incomes Forsaken. The God send for Destiny. Reverted the weapon system, back to primary/special/heavy, added Triumphs that give hours upon hours of gametime, added a new PvEvP gamemode called Gambit a fantastic new raid which is the longest/most encounters for a Destiny raid, introduced Pinnacle weapons, introduced Dungeons with the Shattered Throne, many new weapons that werent reskins,and many other things that made Destiny 2 redeemable. Buy Forsaken for the true Destiny 2 experience. New Light is great for getting a taste for the game, but Forsaken it when things start to really kick offNext came the Seasons, which some are generally liked and disliked by the community. The first was Black Armory. It added the ability to a specific weapon. You would pick up a frame, do some a few tasks, then create a weapon. Eventually, it does become repetitive, but there are 4 different Forges you can do, which some are specific to a weapon. As well, added the Scourge of the Past raid, which is the 1st time we get to use sparrows in a raid.Next came Season of the Drifter, very much criticized and the worst part of the Season Pass (Unless you enjoy Gambit). The whole season revolved around Gambit, and its special PvE mode, Reckoning. Reckoning is a 4 player matchmade activity, where you get kills, build bridges, and wreck bosses, to create Gambit armor and a chance at weapons. But to create the armor, you need Synths, which you attain from Gambit for just playing your role (Invader, Collector, Reaper, Sentry). This DLC as well, had no raid addedLastly, is Season of Opulance, the best season on the pass. It introduced the Menagerie, a way to craft an exact weapon, and masterwork you want, out of a choice of 28 weapons, and 20 armor pieces. As well, introduced the Tribute Hall, great place to test weapons, refill on ammo and add your trophies of your accomplishments. Lastly, included the Crown of Sorrows raid, which seemed to be taken very wellThis review is made before Shadowkeep. But since the launch of Destiny 2, it has recieved very much hate, due to the very poor start. But ever since, Destiny 2 has significantly improved, and with Shadowkeep, Destiny is looking at nothing but the sky. With Shadowkeep, this is our first taste of a DLC, that was made entirely without Activision in the picture. This will now let us see the true colors of Bungie, which is looking very vibrant right now.As in \"Should I buy Destiny?\". Try New Light first. If you like the gunplay, then get Forsaken, as this is when the game very much picks up. By the end of Forsaken, you should have your mind made up on purchasing ShadowkeepEdit : The Shadowkeep DLC turned out to be alright. I think it was a 6.5/10. Had some good things, but Bungee did reuse a good amount of material from Destiny 1 for the Moon. There was definitely some upgrades, but not much added compared to the original Moon. Now Beyond Light is here. We havent got to play with ALL the new content but a very good amount is now playable. Stasis is a good addition, nice to have dark-base subclasses now, but there is certainly some balancing it needs for PvP. But best of all, Stasis allows us to actually customize your subclass again. Not quite the choices at D1, but still get options. Europa is a fantastic new planet, and first time we get a \"dynamic environment\" (Basically just harsh storms and push/pulls you in heavy winds), with a good raid Deep Stone Crypt.Bottomline, is it better than Forsaken? No. Better than Shadowkeep? Yes. If you like Destiny, then you will definitely love this DLC. But dont expect it to cause someone who dislikes it, to now like it again.

But just like the expansions, Bungie has turned to the darkness. The game is increasingly monetized for less and less content, with battle passes, an ever encroaching eververse (in-game store) that swallows any decent cosmetic that might be added, and you still need to buy the expansions. Dont be fooled by the free to play tag, you cant really participate in any worthwhile content without forking over some dough. The base design of the game is also getting worse. The difficulty of the game is almost nonexistent except for a few end game activities, which are only difficult because the enemies will literally one shot you if you stand still for a moment, which isnt really fun or interesting, as it promotes the same strategy for practically every group. Hide behind cover, pop out and shoot for a second, then dive back behind cover. It feels like Bungie is incapable of really figuring out how to create interesting encounters. The classes lack any real variation between them. There is little to their skill trees, even the updated ones in Beyond Light are forgettable, fostering little in terms of flexibility or build. The perk systems for guns and armor are a downgrade from the previous game IMO, giving you a lot of options that usually dont end up impacting your gameplay too much. At the very least, the graphics and art design are superb, along with the sound design and music. If theres one thing the game gets right, its presentation. The UI is mostly intuitive, simple, and easy to grasp. The raids are also good, usually solid experience with very robust mechanics players have to figure out, and that can be fun until they too become too easy. All in all, you would probably be better served picking up the original Destiny and its expansions. Its a far more interesting and memorable experience. Not that Destiny 2 doesnt have improvements over the original, it just focuses on the wrong things and takes two steps back every time it seems like its moving forward.

Im genuinely disappointed with the lack of improvement in the last 6 months or so since they went independent.EDIT 9/8/2020: Now theyre planning to \"vault\" locations that we paid for. Hear that?

Activision needs to take ownership of Destiny again and replace every person at Bungie with competent people. Shadowkeep couldnt hold a candle to Curse of Osiris , much less Forsaken. Season of the Forge type of content is what we should be getting at minimum, yet Bungie graces their customers with less than Season of the Drifter content that removes the seasonal items immediately when its over simply to encourage Fear of Missing Out to get their customers to pay for each season, regardless of quality. Anything thats fun in the game is only fun for a month before it gets nerfed into the ground. See Recluse, see Whisper, see Izanagis in the next patch. Thats even if they get a patch in a timely manner. You couldnt even try and get Izanagis Burden because Bungie broke the quest to obtain it for a month. Lord of Wolves was broken in PVP and it took Bungie a month again to fix it. Really its very disappointing to see Destiny flounder without anyone to rear Bungie in. With each new content drop and each patch it shows that Destiny has been successful only because people at Activision told Bungie that 90% of their ideas were trash.God forbid your internet drops for a second in a single player mission.

The closest experience I can think of is Borderlands, but that is merely online multiplayer, not a true MMO. The Destiny series takes the solid gameplay style from Borderlands and adds on parties, clans, PVP matchmaking, raids, and all sorts of mechanics that MMOs are well-known for. Since its free-to-play now, at the very least its worth a try. The grind might get boring for some people after finishing the store, but theres still a ton of content in the story campaigns and what is there can be several hours of good fun. Definitely recommend it as a game to play with friend(s).That being said, it also feels very flawed at times. The regular expansion releases mean that if you want to have access to all the latest content, you have to shell out a good amount of money. Its kind of equivalent to a subscription-based MMO in that regard, but you arent obligated to pay for the new expansions if you dont want to. (On the plus side, expansion content does go free eventually, it just takes a year or two after its release.) Ive heard claims that the monetization strategy is changing to focus more on seasonal cosmetics, but it remains to be seen if that will actually be a reality - I would not be surprised to see more features thrown behind a (temporary) paywall in the future.The PvP balance can also be really off, both in terms of matchmaking and weapon equality. Power level generally doesnt mean anything, but there are usually a couple weapons which are overpowered and used repeatedly in PvP to annihilate you. I see the pvp aspects as more of a diversifier than a truly competitive experience. There are players who take the competitive part seriously, and you can expect them to destroy you if you dont spend an equally ridiculous amount of time playing FPS games. The time-to-kill is so short and leaves you no opportunity to react - for me, this creates an unsatisfying competitive experience at the higher-end, although Call of Duty is popular for some reason so I guess not everyone feels the way I do.In total, Destiny 2 has a little bit of everything and comes out as a mixed bag. Some parts I really enjoy and other parts not so much. But the beauty of the game is the freedom to choose what types of activities you want to participate in. Sure, there are rewards which are exclusive to particular activities, game modes, and raids. If youre a true collector, you will have to do a bit of everything. But thats only if youre engrossed enough in the game that you feel the need to dive deeper. Theres so much content that you should have tons of hours worth of gameplay that you do enjoy.

The game assumes you played through all of the content from the original Destiny 2 release on Battle.net. If you dont already know this game like the back of your hand, Destiny 2s current release will feel like sprinting headlong into a brick wall while everyone laughs at you for not knowing how to teleport through it.This game was always pretty impenetrable to new players, especially if you never sunk much time into Destiny 1, but the updated introduction for the Steam release takes it to the next level. The introductory mission taken from D1 is an alright way to start up, but it doesnt explain any of the story elements. The player is then dropped into a hub with no explanation and a fully-leveled character. A brand new character unlocks an achievement for reaching 20th level immediately upon beginning the game. Your options at this point are a mixture of random, no-context missions from questgivers youve never been introduced to.Even though your character starts fully leveled, the brand new Shadowkeep content is unavailable at the start. The map screen tells you to gain more power before starting it. Im all for a game that doesnt hold your hand through everything, but handing a brand new player a character with every ability unlocked and providing absolutely no story or context right at the start is a surefire way to get them to refund the game and go play something less ridiculously obtuse instead. The Red War campaign is still the best way to start playing because it has an actual introduction, but it isnt presented to the player right away. Instead, you have to stumble upon it by talking to random vendors until you see one offering a selection of \"Legacy Content\" or some such. \"Legacy\" doesnt exactly sell the idea that this is the actual introduction, and even worse, youre allowed to pick between Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind with no explanation of which comes first chronologically. Curse and Warmind both assume you have played Red War first.Destiny 2 is a good game with a lot of fun content, but Bungie needs to pull their collective head out of their collective ass and stop assuming the world revolves around their games.

Just play something else, like the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV!Ive been playing Destiny since its initial public beta launch back in 2014, since then Ive seen everything that Bungie has done to this game and its a game that I play a lot and enjoy. However having said this, I cannot recommend this game, at all. As the years have rolled on, its become more and more clear that Bungie do not care about the game or its player base. Pros:For a new player theres a lot of content (if you buy the dlcs at least)The shooting and movement feels amazing, making pve and (sometimes) pvp great funRaids are awesome, you never forget your first time through themMajority of the community is great, Ive made so many friends through Destiny and I honestly dont know where Id be right now without itThe worlds in PvE are phenomenally well designed and look gorgeousCons:Where do I start?Like I said, Bungie do not care about this game and only care about the revenue that it makes. Updates are slow to come out, things that break both the PvE and PvP dynamic are introduced constantly and are not addressed for months or sometimes even a year or two. When they do get to \"fixing\" things, they nerf things in the complete wrong way ignoring the communitys feedback completely. For example, the Ace of Spades nerf, Lunas and NF, OEM, Dawnblade, etc. Shadowkeep was an absolute joke of an expansion. A campaign that takes about 5 hours (not rushing it) with 6(ish) missions, one raid, a dungeon, one new armour set, one old retextured armour set (which is the new raid armour), 2 new weapon sets which dont even have one of each weapon type across the both of them and almost every exotic introduced is completely worthless. For a comet expansion (destinys terminology for a big dlc) its an absolute disgrace and nowhere near worth the money. It feels like vanilla D2 again.The season which launched with SK, season of the undying, was equally as pathetic. It introduced a 6 player matchmade activity, which was basically kill adds, destroy crystals, repeat, kill boss. It was incredibly boring and outside of farming either low stat roll armour or one of 4 shockingly average weapons, theres no replayability to it (unless you were going for the title, which is ultimately meaningless as you dont get anything for titles in this game). The exotics introduced in this season were (unsurprisingly) also absolutely awful with no reason to run any of them.Crucible, this games pvp, is also a joke. This is one of the only games to this day that still uses peer to peer connection and you can feel it in game. Games will always have one (or more) person who will take a full second to register damage on. Even in the \"connection based\" playlist you will still have this problem, often playing against people from the other side of the world. Its also full of cheesy tactics, from one hit melees to one hit grenades to a dodge that makes you almost invincible and gives you near full health on a 5 second cool down, its completely imbalanced and never will be balanced. Also the way this game handles aim assist, which you still get on mnk, means that you dont even have to be aiming at someone to hit them.Outside of triumphs and titles, there really is nothing to do in the PvE endgame. You run your raids every week, which youre overleveled for and are incredibly easy, get your pinnacle rewards (of which there are only 4 accessible in the game as of writing this) and try to get good rolls on weapons and armour. Why? Well you either take it into PvP or use it to refine your run times in raids, but most of the weapons that drop from the raids wont be usable in them unless you want to handicap your team. So ultimately, unless you enjoy PvP, there is no point.So why do people (including myself) play this game? Because of friends. If I wasnt in a clan and had friends to play this game with, I wouldnt play this anymore. Destiny is a social game at its core, you need people to play this game with and enjoy the best parts of it. If youre going into this game dead set on playing solo, dont even bother downloading it youre wasting your time (and bandwidth). This game is full of problems; I didnt even touch on the laggy UI, gambit, the paid cosmetics which are becoming more and aggressive and loads more, but its also full of great things if you have people to play it with. Whether its running your first raid, hitting hard cap on gear, getting that exotic or god roll youve been chasing, hitting max rank in the competitive crucible playlist, etc. I really want to give this game a recommendation, I really do, but in its current state with how the sandbox is, how slow the updates are, the community managers that are \"passing on feedback\" but we never see anything change, I just cannot recommend it. I love this game, but I also hate it. If youre looking for a competitive game, this is not your game. If things change, then you should play this game. If you have friends that play this or are looking for friends, play this game. If youre looking for a game where you can just sit back and shoot things after a long day, play this game (and pick up a pulse rifle). If youre looking to sink your time into a game and are only going to main one game, probably go and play FF14 or some other MMO.", "Author": "Blink", "Hours": 2361.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 1, 2019", "Review": "Justice for Marty.", "Author": "Psychedelic Adventurer", "Hours": 23.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 3, 2020", "Review": "Not bad considering its free", "Author": "floppysrb_", "Hours": 45.9}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 27, 2021", "Review": "TL;DR-You will grind. Whether you like it or not, you WILL GRIND. There is nothing you can do to get the time you spent, BACK. Consider how precious your time and focus is. The hype is leading you to trash. I have put myself into the shoes of a new customer and veteran player. I will say this - nothing they dangle as bait is worth the trouble and loss of time and progress.Heed the warning, continue to read the full review. Save. Your. Time.UPDATE:Not worth wasting 1k hours for. All your work is in vain. In the next upcoming DLC (Witch Queen) the content resets all your leveling progress anyways.  Any work you put into the game is now gone completely.They create a lot of artificial grind for all content activity. Along with artificial difficulty as well. Their seasonal passes are there to entice you to power level and to give you absolutely nothing of true value. Essentially they gate you with their base games level grind then they introduce a PAID solution to help expedite your leveling HOWEVER you STILL have to work for that extra experience bonus % which is gated by cash purchases.There was a point in time when Destiny 2 was solid and I mentioned that time in my old review. But even so, the problems youll come to face are not worth your time and effort for grinding out levels, gear or weapons.Its not a fun game as many would like you to think and even though you may enjoy it because you are new. You will eventually see the reality of all the gate-keeping in the game.The game has an issue where there is a lot to do but all of those activities are one and the same. There are few distinct activities that are actually fun and require a brain: Namely pvp, raids and SOME seasonal activities. The core game itself is barren and boring. The story telling is juvenile and unremarkable. I do not feel anything for these characters or the universe. To hear conversations about something unimportant that will not leave a mark in my experience at all. There is a reason for this: the old destiny developers and the new developers have NO IDEA what their game is about. It is really ran on improvisation and nothing is original or interesting.OLD REVIEW:I would have played this game if it didnt feel like I was at a job. I dont leave work just to come home and work for new level cap that is outdated as soon as I log off. Dont at me if youre too blinded by the hype and not the consistency and health of the game play loop. I like to grind for new loot sure but not a layered system of \"Go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourself, you work here now.\" The game died when I left it in 2020. So whatever you are playing is a husk and shell of its former glory. You cant say a turd is better after you sprinkle it with chocolate chips. Unless youre into \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, then you probably dont need the chocolate chips with it. Because you didnt have good taste anyways if you like this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.", "Author": "ViLe", "Hours": 1151.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: March 22, 2020", "Review": "I have come to terms with the fact that this game is over. Gladd streaming new games, all my old friends have been offline for more than two weeks. Ive spoken to only 3 of my clanmates recently and the rest that are always offline used to be extremely active. With the death of worldline, the raid farmers have quit farming, leaving lfg discord servers and console lfg platforms barren. High end player are lost and dont know what to do. The only new activity that was truly brought this season was a public event, and the public event is exactly the same on all planets. I have decided that I will be better off finding a new game, or quitting gaming all together, even if it means that I wont be able to cope with many problems now. Im going to wait to see what destiny 2 has to offer next season. I highly recommend that if you are new or beginning an interest in the game, to quit now. This game isnt worth the struggle, youll find that all repeatable activities become a chore, raids become frustrating with different people each time. Without a team that can actually consistently hit crits on the boss, you wont two phase, sometimes even three phase any boss. The new grandmaster nightfall will be a joke. The last crucible and gambit matches I played had atleast one cheater on the enemy team. This game is going to become the next Gta 5. Clickbait, cheating, and only fun when you do stupid things like out of bounds glitches. I apologize to anyone who has invested more than 1000 hours into this game.

While it seemed the soloist style player could have a majority of the primo weapons and gear to be able to compete in pvp that all changed with the Moon expansion.  The game has now doubled down on forming your own groups outside the groupfinder to complete a lot of the content.  It is this same content that awards weapons that are superior to what you can get through solo/groupfinder play.  The result is losing in pvp arenas with subpar weapons.  Kind of sad because the game had balance at one time but now favors the super try hards who run group operations.  The moon supposedly has a beautiful garden interior kind of like Wrath of Kahn but regular non-raiders never get to see it.

Im not exaggerating, its that good. Its why the game can get away with grindier quests and why I keep coming back to Destiny. Its a lot of fun. A rewarding and varied loot grind, with little fear of missing out. Ive still got quests I picked up last year, and can finish them at my leisure. A story deeply intwined with lore. Hey remember when Destiny 1 came out and everyone complained that it didnt have a story? Not so anymore. Bungie has done an excellent job of pulling plot threads from many lore locations. The lore itself is huge, I highly recommend MyNameIsByf on Youtube, or ishtar-collective.net if you want to see how deep it goes. A pretty great build system. While not as deep as other looter-shooters (to keep gamemodes from being ruined by a god build), Destiny 2 provides a very nice build system that offers tons of different ways to experiment with your playstyle, especially now that Armor 2.0 is out with Shadowkeep. A dev team that cares. After sticking with this game through two rough launches, its clear that the entire Destiny dev team is passionate about what theyre making. Even more so now that Activision is out of the picture. Earnable Cosmetics. While this game does contain microtransactions, the devs have been upfront about their use to fund new content. Thanks to MTX, we got Zero Hour, a challenging race against the clock to get a new Exotic, funded entirely through Exotic weapon ornaments. No Pay To Win. With the introduction of Universal Ornaments, there is no MTX content in the game that provides an advantage. The only paid content that can give an advantage are the DLC campaigns, which come with their own sets of armor and weapons. I feel like thats reasonable though, a consequence of how Destiny content is distributed.The Bad The game has some growing pains. Some parts of this game are currently carried over from the old Destiny 2 framework, such as Power Level. Because of this, your character will start at Power Level 750. Its a bit strange, but its probably better than resetting to zero, risking player outrage and accidentally impossible content. PvP Balance is kind of broken. Because this is a looter shooter, people will get better equipment than you. Naturally, to counter this, you can go and get some better equipment for yourself. While Power Level doesnt affect PvP (with some exceptions), some exotics, heavy weapons and Super abilities can dominate the meta more than others. Some people really hate this. Some quests are pretty grindy for no reason. If you play the game just to complete quests, they can feel like chores sometimes. If you dont enjoy the gunplay and gamefeel (though why wouldnt you?) you probably wont enjoy the game long-term.In Conclusion...Its a good game, in my opinion. Id recommend downloading it and trying it for yourself instead of scrolling through biased reviews. Its entirely free to play through tons of older content, and theres a lot of it.See you starside, Guardian.", "Author": "probably not a furry", "Hours": 342.6}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: May 2, 2021", "Review": "Came back after a 2 year hiatus only to find that the game had removed half the content from when I last played, then get asked to drop $50 to unlock the new content.

You will regret it.PvE:Its ok, but it really needs a revamp on the storytelling and interaction to the gameplay. Some strikes have been either from Destiny 1 or just really old, like 3 years old. While theres 1-2 new strikes as of Beyond Light, it is still not enough. End-game content is also fine, I have no comment about that. However, this game mode really needs a node where you can gild your title instantly instead on waiting for another one weekly and gild it 3 weeks at the end of the season, then resets again. Why????PvP:I understand the team is trying hard to balance exotics and weapons, and bringing nerfs to overpowered items, it feels more balanced and players are more able to make builds that work for their liking. However, with the player base inflating, more players improved, depending on how much time they played in this mode. Dont expect 3kds in this season if you played enough. You gotta actually sweat now. Not fun.Trials is amazing now, but it really need new maps ASAP. Its not fun having to play the same maps over and over again. With the team balancing and new anti cheat, cheaters are less prevalent but there will always be a few lurking around, so expect that. Rewards are ok, but the cosmetics do need to drop more often, to make players play more. Also, do remove the flawless pool. With declining numbers, matching is harder for everyone because of the cycle of bad maps and rewards. While being a short-term solution it is not the way to go as of now.Gambit (PvE/PvP):Dont play it. No incentive, no nothing. I want that game mode to die.Raids:The devs did said that they would bring old raids back, which is fun; but the game is too big for our own good. I wonder how they would be fixing this size issue.VERDICT:Its ok, but do expect content drought whenever a new DLCs about to drop. Really need to manage your time properly and DO NOT spend too much time on a game mode you already achieved for. The game aesthetics beautiful and the storytelling with so much depth, it is hard to drop this game. If youre a dedicated player like I do, hehe.

Between Xbox at the start, PS4, Battlenet, and here, Im probably north of a total of 10,000 hours on this one, probably 1000 to 2000 in the first game (much better, Id actually recommend that over this garbage). There are plenty of other developers out there who wont treat you with this much disrespect. Season of the Worthy has made it go into disconnect loops about every 15 minutes, so its unplayable right now. Not that Id particularly want to play it anymore. Until Luke Smith is terminated from the company for his complete and total failure as Creative Director, feel free to look elsewhere.  If the abilities are what appeal to you, print off a list of literally any RPGs you can think of, put 4 layers of duct tape over your eyes, and throw a knife at that list, then play any of the games that it hit. Or dont. Go outside, sit in the sun, get cancer--at least that has economic value for the doctors who have to save you. If its the gunplay, COD and Battlefield are similar but fall short by a bit, R6Siege feels the closest but with added tactical elements--and if Im being completely honest, it actually feels better for being more realistic.  But dont worry, Bungie will find a way to ruin the feel of even their gunplay--they always do. Not in whole, but in part--every gun you come to love in this title will be taken from you in some way. Its a great lesson in loss--if you havent experienced loss in your life, Id suggest you try it--it wont hurt as much, its just a game after all, but it can at least simulate the experience on a microcosmic scale. If its the PVE elements that appeal to you, know that you have been abandoned. What made Destiny 1 great was Kings Fall, Wrath of the Machine, the Vault of Glass, and to a lesser extent Crotas End.  Nightfalls were much more rigid but were always appropriately rewarding.  This is a debauchery of that former content.  The most memorable raid here is probably Last Wish, but the mechanics were convoluted to the point that the majority of the player base resorted to cheese methods for its final encounter. Memorable is a funny word--I wont be long remembering any of these raids. All creativity is gone as well--there are no raid unique perks to be seen. There are no best-in-class weapons to be had anymore. Any semblance of protection from Bungies reliance on RNG in a loot pool that is simultaneously microscopic in terms of the number of items and enormous in the unique combinations possible is long gone from the IP. It is just one soul crushing run after the next for no reward of consequence.  Nightfalls are now an exercise in exacting precision--theyre more like a classical dance such as the Waltz. The steps, the loadouts, the strategies are locked in stone as Bungie tries to infuse the game with difficulty rather than new and enjoyable content.  Its the sort of difficulty symptomatic of the lazy, uninspired, and unoriginal--add health ad nauseam  and increase AI damage output.  Any semblance of a mechanic is thinly veiled behind that premise--including the new champions. The rewards are paltry and inappropriate to the length of time it will take to complete the activity. Your time being disregarded is a theme with these cretins.   If its the PVP that appeals to you, God have mercy upon you.  Its a more enjoyable time trying to kill your opponents in Mario Kart on the Rainbow Road du jour.  Between the heavy handed balancing patches that do nothing to instill actual balance, there are moments of agonizing struggle as Bungie fails to exact change, leaving a meta and a parameta.  I said parameta for a reason: try as they might, they are unable to affect real change on the actual  meta because they are hindered by so many other shortcomings and ignorant, foolish design choices from the early days of the title, and the meta in this title is largely meaningless anyway.  The result then is that you have a meta form and dominate players--not just with a slight edge but a soul crushing, domineering omnipresence--for about a year at a time until the hammer falls to totally annihilate it. The problem here, aside from the ghost town of playlists it creates as people stop beating their heads into a soupy pulp and realize that all hope is lost to those who enter in, is that for the few who are able to power through the RNG drops for meta weapons on the order of several millionths of a percent to get the right drops to have a full meta loadout there forms an emotional attachment to the weapons, and their resulting obscurity post balancing patch is akin to having your dog killed by the ATF. Unfortunately, even the meta does not a difference make--having had at some time or another a true meta loadout at various points, eventually one comes to the realization that the lack of care put in to creating the PVP modes in this game is the real culprit here--the overly small maps, the detritus that needlessly litters the fields of play offering minimal cover from Bungies absurd networking choices--it just isnt enjoyable because in their quest for balance, the best one can hope to shave off of a time to kill is about a half a second--only marginally slower than a blink. Thus, even the meta isnt better than the parameta or even the off-meta loadouts.  Its all placebo. Gambit is a travesty. Im not wasting any more time on this. The game has devolved into a series of bugs that go whole quarters or semi-annual cycles without address.  Bungie and their fanbase like to blame this on the size of the game. This is pathetic.  I work in software. We have a build every other week. We can do an immediate the second the code is finished. Our platform is nearing 20 years old.  I do not and will not ever buy this as an excuse, because it is pathetic, it is vapid, it is egregious.  Nay, the reality is that Bungie is just lazy. They are lazy and they are arrogant. They think that by playing up their old image from the Halo days as a small studio with a hit title they can coast by through their failings without needing to address their sheer and utter failures as an independent developer subject to LBI laws and treated as a large employer by US Tax Code.  Its often posited that they are greedy--and good if they are, they are a business after all.  But the reality of being a business is that you must produce a product that people are willing to buy, and to be successful that product must have outsized value greater than its price, and that price must be greater than its cost. Bungie has inverted this time-worn model and attempted to pervert it--the value is gone, the cost is hidden in microtransactions, in season passes, and in annual expansions, and the cost in terms of development hours is hidden in smoke but from all outward appearances must be minimal. They think, and have thus far been enabled by their rabid community-the root of the majority of problems with the title today-that by simply whining and lamenting the difficulties of their day to day that they will be excused for being a failure who will not support their product adequately, who are unable to produce a quality offering in a market dominated by players who can--and have--swallowed them whole. Welcome, Luke, welcome, Bungie, to the free market as a free and independent corporation. May you be ravaged for the charades you are.Edit: I would like to expand on my review. I no longer think that this game is just merely bad and shouldnt be recommended. I think it shouldnt even exist. Bungie are stuck in 2006 and cant move on from that era. They should go bankrupt.

With the move to free-to-play the game has never been more accessible. Yes, there is a lot of content to catch up on, but what I love most about this game is the seemingly infinite grind. Whether it be for exotic weapons, the perfect armor set or the ever-prestigous title, Destiny 2 has something for everyone. Players interested in more campaign/RPG-esque gameplay can stick to the story and PvE activities such as Vanguard Strikes, Gambit or Raids. Where players who want to dip into the competitive PvP aspects can find their fix in the Crucible. With rotating playlists in the Crucible and a decent competitive playlist, Ive found a love-hate relationship with Destinys PvP system. The gameplay is crisp and clean, and reminds me of the days where I would play Halo 3 on Xbox. The gunplay is snappy and the speed of each match is the perfect balance of high stakes and methodical.However, as with many shooters, there are builds and certain weapons and armor pieces that definitely outshine others in PvP. As a new player, this can be a bit frustrating to play against. Not to mention balancing isnt always prompt so some broken builds can really dominate the Crucible. What I think is most frustrating about Destiny is its end game systems. With Shadowkeep, endgame content and the soft level cap have been put to the test and it seems most people agree that the grind is somewhat frustrating and baseless. A lot of RNG goes into this game, so be prepared for that.But even with its faults, I have been coming back to this game constantly.

Currently, I have 1300+ hours and thats all from coming back at the start of Beyond Light. During those hours I have accumulated hundreds of moments and memories that Ill always cherish with my friends. This game has faults, but I wouldnt trade it for the stupid fun Ive had with my friends and other fellow Guardians Ive met along the way. I do want to mention one major complaint and thats about D2s difficulty in being accessible to newer and sometimes even returning players such as myself. D2 at its most basic framework as a looter-shooter is amazing and I believe that Bungie has nailed their games combat to feel constantly good. But at a cost, it leaves their \"RPG/MMO\" aspects to be less desired and even confusing for newcomers. I was very lucky to have friends that were playing before Beyond Light and had a great understanding of the new mod systems and etc. Going through the process to understand everything is extremely daunting for newer players because the tutorial is less than desired in teaching them how to utilize the more intricate features of D2.

In a sentence, Id call destiny borderlands if borderlands took itself seriously and was an MMO lite. Once a player is done with the initial level grind, there are plenty of high-level activities to be done, as well as titles and weapons to chase after. If you like PvP, then the Crucible is for you. It has casual objective-based play, free-for-all modes, competitive modes, as well as an occasional special mode: The Iron Banner. Here, ranks are earned faster, but the stakes are higher. Iron Banner also has a unique loot pool, so youll want to hop in and get said loot before the week is up and Lord Saladin leaves the Tower to return another day.If you like PvE more, then you can gather a few friends and hop into a Raid, a 6-person activity with unique mechanics, weapons, armour and more. These raids have several encounters that require teamwork between all 6 people to complete, and at the end you will fight an enemy that is more or less a big threat to The Last City, Earth, or even the entire system.Maybe you like a mix of both? Enter, Gambit. Two teams of 4 battle to destroy the most enemies and bank the dark essence they drop. However, every 25 motes banked opens up a portal to the other side. This portal allows a player to invade the other side and take out the opposing team and slow them down. Banking 75 (100 in Gambit Prime) summons a primeval, a powerful interdimensional beast. The first team to kill their primeval will win. However, for every player on your team an invader kills, your primeval will heal. Gambit is a game where you dont win by being fast, you win by slowing your enemy down.The game isnt for everyone though, and can be pretty expensive if you decide to commit to all the DLC, season passes and the like. Everything that came out in the games first year is free to everyone however, so there isnt anything to lose by trying the game out.If you do decide to join Destiny 2, you should keep in mind that the game is unfortunately awful at teaching new players all the mechanics and intricacies of the games MANY systems.

Destiny 2 is similar to Warframe; you pick one of three classes (Hunter, Titan, or Warlock) and customize it, then you can play through the campaign, do strikes/raids, side quests, the list goes on.+Pros+Absolutely beautiful graphics. I started this game on a 2GB graphics card and could easily run medium settings with no FPS lag and beautiful visuals. Now that I have upgraded to an 8GB card, the graphics are just absolutely breathtaking.+The game is now free to play, existing users received a huge Power boost as well. Both new and existing players will already have all Year 1 DLC, thanks to Bungie.+There is so much content in this game; most of it can be completed without the need to grind all day, which is really nice.+You can play with 2 other friends for co-op, making the total party size 3 players. There is also a PvP mode that you can play with more than 3 friends.+Fun and impressive combat. You can use anything from scout rifles, assault rifles, snipers, swords, fusion rifles, grenade launchers, and many more--all of which can be acquired from playing the game, no micro-transactions needed. Each class also has their own super ability, which has 3 subclasses that you can use depending on how you prefer to fight.+Gameplay doesnt get repetitive, unlike Warframe, which became awfully repetitive for me to the point where I just stopped playing and moved to D2, which has been great.-Cons-Messy Day 1 Steam release, but that is to be expected for a lot of games. People are having issues with game crashes and connection issues; many of which are thrown into massive login queues, then the server went down.-You still need to purchase the Forsaken DLC if you want that, but players are still able to visit the locations and use the gear.-Although this game is great, Im not expecting it to be perfect the entire time, so I will edit this review a few months from now.Bungie is definitely one of those companies that has been looked down upon for the longest time, but adding Destiny 2: New Light and ditching Activision was probably the best decision they have ever made. I suggest everybody who has never played Destiny or Destiny 2 to try this game out (no, you do not need to play Destiny 1 in order to enjoy Destiny 2).

I have enjoyed my time with Destiny 2. I was very put off while they were under the thumb of Activision/Blizzard and stopped playing for a while. I recently came back when they left and enjoyed the content again. I was not really interested in the Season Pass so I didnt really think much of it and just played through. Then the next season pass came out with much of the story and other content blocked behind the paywall of the newest season pass. It was annoying but I was able to do some of the content not as much as I would have liked but I played it quite a bit. Now comes the Season of the Worthy, which in my opinion should be the Season of the Whale because virtually everything related to this season pass is locked behind it. Sure you can participate in the live events, but you wont get anything from it, a bit of exp, and glimmer, and friendly reminder to pay for the season pass if you want to progress past the third mission which requires you to buy an upgrade for the bunker that you just liberated. Well you cant buy an upgrade without, you guessed it buying the season pass. You want to participate in the Trials, buy the season pass. I would have rather waited and had the last three season passes rolled into another expansion. So guess what is likely never ever going to have another expansion, Destiny 2. Why? Because they can just roll out another season pass.

It combines ARPG and looter-shooter elements in both PvE and PvP formats. It can be described as \"Warframe with lots of platforming and jumping puzzles.\" You explore different planets and moon, shoot stuff, collect resources, and wait for loot to drop.This comes from the makers of the classic Halo, and I really wanted to like this game. I struggled with whether to put the thumb up or down with this title. Its borderline, and Id rather give it a \"thumbs-sideways,\" but will have to give it a slight thumbs down for now.Why? The visual and sound design are fantastic. Gunplay is satisfying. Weapon mods are clever. Theres lots of content (for now, but more on that below). The community is one of the better ones Ive come across.But...The game was released in 2017 and (parts of it) made free in 2019 when Bungie severed its relationship with Activision. Dont get me wrong, DLC and microtransactions can be legitimate ways to make money, but I dont like how its implemented in this particular title. Theres a distinct pay-to-win vibe about the game, and at the same time disdain for those who actually pay.In June 2020, Bungie announced it would retire most of the content that original purchasers had paid for in September 2020. This is also most of the F2P content. This move both erased much of the incentive to play the free version and angered a substantial portion of the dedicated base who had bought the title.Rightly so. Many top guns and other inventory players had worked hard to acquire since Day 1 -- and because loot is procedurally generated with random stats, \"top\" is a very small tier -- can simply disappear in the September update.Also, as a fan of other looter-shooters, it confuses me as to why one begins at rank 700-something, why theres no linearity with a single campaign story, and for what reason one mostly encounters \"rare\" and \"legendary\" loot if these are the default drops. It also suffers, in common with Warframe, a problem of far too many currencies.Bungie could have learned from how in 2019, in anticipation to the release of Borderlands 3, series fans were treated to a free visual upgrade of both B1 and B2, as well as new free DLC for B2 with a new rarity tier -- and that was for a game from 2012!Besides the upcoming removal of about half the game and associated gear and challenges, there are numerous issues which while not gamebreaking in themselves add to an unpleasant experience. Frequent disconnects from servers despite having great internet; a wait of 2-3 minutes to verify ones account every time you start the game; lack of anticheat protection for the PvP mode; and insufficient ammo drops for class 2 (\"heavy\" weapons, that is, shotguns and snipers) are only some of those annoyances.I do think this title still has potential, and perhaps at some later date it will iron out its many issues. I wish the developers and the community the best.

But one of the core aspects of Destiny--the thing I liked about it--was chasing weapons and bringing them with you on your journey.The nature of live games is that they change. A game you put thousands of hours into--and I have so many more on battlenet before Destiny was moved to steam--suddenly changes as the devs patch it. Thats why Im writing a negative review now.

Just last night, I realized that I could no longer get to the Tangled Shore or Mercury. I attempted to relaunch the Prison of Elders mission, assuming that I had to \"re-earn\" access to the Shore. Upon loading in the mission, I was stuck on a floating platform. In sight, there were two parallel walls and a platform behind me too high to jump to. No other textures loaded. That particular issue was resolved by completely restarting the mission.I was a day one Destiny 2 player. The game has come far since that day, but its not far enough. There are too many strange little quirks for me to recommend this game. Current content is beautifully made, but woefully out of reach for new players. The extreme and bizarre instability of the current version is very Destiny 1 of Bungie and I hate it.I cant begin to explain how much I hate the PVP in this game. Crucible and Gambit are garbage and I despise how much content is tied to them. I am currently stuck on a mission that requires Gambit gameplay. Why would you focus on PVP in such a massive universe? That is the stupidest choice I have ever seen you guys make, and Ive played all of your games since Marathon.8/26/2021: Hey Bungie, just came back to ask a simple question: What the hell is wrong with you? You took a perfectly functional game and ruined it. I cant play a single moderately long mission in the current build without crashing. It is not my hardware. It is not my drivers. The only change is the game. Get your ducks in a row.Im sick of this, Bungie. Its almost a constant cycle of bad release, good release, bad release, good release. Is it a testing issue? Is it a dev issue? I dont care what it is, I just want it resolved. Very simple internal testing would find these issues but if you did, you chose to release a broken version.Bungie is being acquired by Sony. If content does end up exclusive to Playstation, Im done.Oh, and these idiots do server maintenance in the middle of the day. Are you serious? Why would you maintain servers in the middle of the day?

This game is trying to be huge in alot of ways but forgot to be fun. It is a problem and with  BEYOND LIGHT  bungie shows that they will not do a thingy-dingy with it.Bungie will not implement any new and FUN mechanics to make players have fun during doing the same things over and over and over for years.  Youll realise it if you buy beyoned lieght.  Gunplay is may look fun for first time, then it quickly becomes repetative and boring -  no fun guns . After you get enough experience and knowledge about game you realise that this game have problems with \"exotics\" weapons: they not giving new ways to kill opponents or being better in any way than legendaries neither in PVE or PVP. I have most of exotics and legendaries i have a nice wide weapon choice but for past couple seasons i ended up playing with only legendary stuff.   Classes and Abilities This game has 3 \"different classes\" you have class ability, grenades and melee abilities which tied to ultimative super abilites (with perks tied to it). Is 3 classes really different?  No.  The thing is: supers can only transform you into sup and let you have fun for limited time or do burst damage.  And this concept is shared between all classes.Also you cannot fully customize your perks, passives and melee abilities tied to its own trees with supers.   Difference between classes  is your CLASS abilities (not counting supers), and jumps.The only unqiue and fun trees is Titans middle solar and bottom void trees. Warlocks and hunters looks dull compared to Titans \"captain america mode\".   Quests  is repetative and frustrating. No interesting tasks. Most of them is just about killing things.  Whats bad?  Well it may ask you to make it in a very boring way so at the end of your questline youll want to have a rest from the game for months.  Definition of \"challenge\" is NOT \"repetative, boring, frustrating\" and bungie dont understand that.   Platforming  It is only part of the game where you notice difference between Titans Warlocks and Hunters.  Platforming itself is simple but interesting and can be challenging.It is actually feels like bungie dont want you have fun with their game.This review is already became huge enough for steam page so im not gonna include here all possible solutions for the mentioned issues but my wishes for the game:   I really wish they implement new movement features in game making existing platforming truly shine.  Also wish they improve sliding: In its current state its purpose is unclear and i personally not using it outside of crucible.  they wont    I really wish they implement new gunplay features in game which will really add new ways to deal with enemies.  It is what you do for the 90% and it must evolve and remain fun.  they wont    I really wish they make classes unique from each other it must have bigger impact on overall gameplay.  I really dont understand why make 3 different classes if they doing the same thing with same way.  they wont   i just want do the same things we doing in this game for years but in a fun way please Weekly bounties, daily bounties, lots of battle pass lvls.  This concept is okay if its rewards properly (with content or great fun).  But this game in its current state is feels like a job.Played for 400+hours on another platfrom and i must warn you: this game makes you keep playing it with its implemented RNG-casino system and not fun gameplay features.

But man how it has had its ups and downs. After 1300 hours played, its hard to recommend this game once you hit end game content. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I never played Destiny 1, so I went into the beta of D2 with no knowledge of how the game worked, the classes, the worlds, lore, anything. I loved the game at first and was very excited for the release of the game back in 2017. I loved the base game and had a great time with it, but the base game was missing end game activities, which made me ease playing for a bit. Curse of Osiris and Warmind came and went, and I played both DLCs, but I still didnt stick around for long because of the lack of things to do once you beat the story and leveled your character to max light level. Forsaken released in 2018, and I was excited to get back in to the game. Forsaken launch was a magical time, two whole new destinations, a new game mode, so many sandbox fixes, the bounty system from Destiny 1, one of the biggest raids the franchise has seen, and a new addition to the franchise with the dungeon. Year 2 of D2 is where I played the majority of my hours, I had so much fun with the game and exploring everything new. The mini DLCs that released in year 2 were fairly decent, apart from the season of the drifter which did not interest me in the slightest. I had not cared for the gambit game mode, and having a whole season revolve around that did not interest me that much. Year 3 is where the game started to struggle. Shadowkeep was a good DLC, a decent amount of content. new raid, a new dungeon, a new destination to explore. Shadowkeep did not meet many peoples expectations because of the lack of content, which Bungie justified with the new season pass model, which was their greatest mistake.The season pass model does not work for Destiny. The new thing to do is an activity that lasts for around 3 months, then once the season is over the activity is gone forever. The pass also has free/paid rewards, ranking all the way to 100 like a standard battle pass. Filled with cosmetics, emotes, icons, ships, sparrows, AND HIGH stat armor for the PAID part of the pass. This model creates a sense of FOMO, so you have to always play to earn everything, which isnt healthy for the casual playerbase. Everyone is burning out on the game because of the lack of incentive to play. As Datto (a highly watched player in the D2 community) has said, \"There is so much stuff to do and none of it matters\". If you have god rolled weapons/armor, theres nothing to chase. Every season offers new weapons/armor, but whats the point if you already have the best guns/armor already?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a great game to get in to if youre new, plenty to do, fun activities, the progression in the game is satisfying, earning good gear is an amazing feeling.

But even more painful is the fact that our protagonist is still unable to speak, so it is Ghost, who accompanies us, who speaks for us. Needless to say, this was a very cheap move in 2017 and absolutely does not help the smooth storytelling, while it completely trashes the otherwise sometimes brilliantly written situations and dialogues.All this is also incomprehensible to me because Bungie has built all the main characters very well. They are all completely different personalities, each with their own role in the story. There is Ghaul, for example, who only seems to be a typical villain who is out to take over the world. In reality, he is a much more complex figure who nevertheless gets very little screen time. Of the trio of Ikora, Zavala and Cayde-6, the latter of course takes the lead, but newcomers such as Failsafe, the personality-disordered AI, Hawthorne and Devlin are more exciting characters than we are. All of them have a deep enough background, a personality, and we get to know them not only through conversations with them, but also by completing side missions.The outline of what to do will be familiar to those who have followed the first part and its development. Bungie has already redrawn the foundations and taken them in a new direction with the various additions, and the second part could now build on them massively. While the aforementioned campaign offers a variety of missions, the real work to be done is beyond the story. The side quests, or Adventures, are much more varied this time around, and are essentially designed to fill in the gaps in the story. The Lost Sector has its own challenges, including some of the toughest opponents on the planet, and there are various public events that are much easier to complete thanks to the newly introduced Director. We even get to see when the next group fun event, rich in opponents and fat loot, is coming up. If thats not enough, you can of course compete in Strike, Nightfall, with a different Strike every week for a limited time, or the more challenging post-endgame Raids, while online battlefield enthusiasts can find a home in the PvP arenas.Yet Bungie has managed to salt the recipe away a little. Its no use having so many options if youre streamlining them with one or two decisions that make the post-campaign period more difficult, or at least less exciting. Side missions, for example, are a one-off experience, so even if they can be played over and over again, players may not want to return. If only because the spectacular locations and planets are completely empty and deserted, despite the vast area that can be explored. There are no NPCs, no branching off, no additional side threads. The missions in the story are not always replayable, and even if they are, you are only entitled to randomly selected missions.A more unfortunate limitation is that Strikes are not given a free hand, so you can only take part in a random series of missions. Its a similar situation with PvP, or Crucible, where you really only have the choice of joining one of the Quickplay or Competitive modes. Its up to the game to decide which game mode you get within that. Its an incomprehensible choice, as theres plenty to choose from and its far from certain that players will like them all.In Countdown, which is making its PvP debut, the attacking team must plant a bomb in one of two pre-designated locations, while the defending team must prevent it. Anyone who bites the dust will be forced to wait until someone comes to revive them. Of course, if you fail to plant and arm the bomb, and the entire team dies in the process, the round is over, as it is if you fail to deactivate it. Of the other options, Clash is the same as before, while Supremacy and Control have been modified just a tiny bit. Just enough, of course, to make the tactics youve known before not work. Part of the reason for this is that Bungie has trimmed the team size, reducing the line-up from the previous six-on-six to two against four. This has made all of Crucibles gameplay much tighter and more tactical, where theres no room for individuality and its really all about teamwork.In the spirit of simplification and streamlining, character development is also more transparent than before, but Bungie has also introduced a lot of restrictions in return. The fact that we didnt get any new selectable factions is problematic in itself, but instead of over a dozen abilities, we now only have eight or eight, and you cant even combine them. And yes, to make matters worse, only one of the four of these can be active, which severely limits our special abilities and the other properties that come with them, be it melee strikes or grenade types.Whats proved to be a super move, however, is that the classification of weapons has also changed, so instead of the previous primary, special and heavy, mordals are now categorised based on Kinetic, Energy and Power. Theres a much wider range of weapons to choose from, while its also much easier to narrow down which weapons to use against which types of opponents. Kinetic weapons are effective against unarmoured enemies, while energy weapons are effective against those with various shields. The icing on the cake is that the gunplay is still a lot of fun, which is actually one of Destinys greatest fortunes. Many times I felt like I didnt want to grind, but the gunplay made me put aside my negative feelings and enjoy the new encounters. Even if Bungie didnt bother to add any new enemy types or, heaven forbid, new races to the game world.And its this kind of blatant recycling, the many, many fishy crossovers, and the carry-over from Destinys first part and DLC that really makes you question whether this second part is a true sequel. Destiny 2 seems more like a fine-tuned, streamlined installment that fixes the mistakes of the previous one than a clear sequel. Destiny 2 is the game that the first part of Destiny was supposed to be, in order to give us the kind of incredibly intense experience that, say, Mass Effect or the sequel to Uncharted, and basically the second parts, used to give us. Destiny 2, on the other hand, is no louder or more spectacular than its predecessor, but it does remedy its shortcomings, while also pushing a number of limitations that fundamentally define the endgame of the game. And yet, for some reason, it works. It sucks you in, it doesnt let you down, except when technical problems prevent you from picking up a gun again and again. But the latter can be remedied, as can deeper bugs over time.

I wanted to replay the game to see what had changed, when I logged in from steam I was told to migrate my account from Battle.Net, so i did that, then I logged in and got back into the game with my old character. I was thrown right into the beyond light expansion mission opening. When I finished that and opened my worlds map, it was shockingly empty. There were only four planets available and the cosmodrone was back. Like what? I tried making a new character because I wanted to re-play the red war campaign, and when I loaded up my new character, I was just given the opening to Destiny 1, but even then there were pieces missing from that opening. So I went to google, turns out THAT THEY DELETED ALL OF THE OLD CAMPAIGNS AND FOUR PLANETS!!!!??? Like WHAT??? WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? The only thing that I can do as a free to play player now is aimlessly wander around one of THE FOUR open maps. And as far as I can tell, nobody is mad at this. All of they ride or die players probably didnt even notice that a massive chunk of the game is just GONE because the only thing they care about is their loot, and the devs can only see this as \"streamlining the game for new players\" NO thats not whats happening! Now the only choice left for new players is to spend $70 on a \"free to play\" game that they wont even know anything about BECAUSE THE OPENING OF THE GAME IS GONE. The game is filled with holes now.

Theres a million things Id change or improve on, but I could say that for any game. Even with what we have now, Destiny 2 is close to my perfect game.Be warned though, it does feel a bit scammy. They straight up deleted half the content and it took them a year to replace it with the same amount of (admittedly better) content. The best future for Destiny is one that can make room to keep all of the content and not shift it around.Regardless, thats one large con among the leagues of large positives. Its a trade Im learning to accept. (But Bungie if youre reading this random-ass review, just combine D1+2 and all the expansions and make the biggest game you can, itll be lit).Heres to the next 2000 hours!", "Author": "Blank", "Hours": 1982.3}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: May 24, 2020", "Review": "Ive played a ton of Destiny and Destiny 2 across PS4 and PC. I used to love the game. The lore was amazing if you felt so inclined to go digging for it, or happened to watch an I Am Byf video on Youtube. Shooting and traversing the world feel amazing, and there are so many weapons to experiment with!That was until Bungie announced that they plan to sunset the weapons they feel are to hard to continue to balance against new content. Some of these weapons took weeks, possibly months for people to grind or get the perks they wanted on. Bungie is doing this in order to fight \"power creep\" which I understand and actually approve of, but instead of approaching the problem with a little grace and finesse they are taking a giant broom and sweeping away all of our hard earned weapons and armor.Bungie has no respect for their players time or financial investment. They say they will be introducing new and more interesting loot to replace what we are losing, but of course we have to take that on faith which I am fresh out of. Bungie also stated that they will re-issue weapons that are being sunset in the future, but if they think Im doing another 3 week grind for my Redrix in that garbage fire they call PvP they are wildly mistaken. I think I would rather spend my money elsewhere...and so should you.If this was the only issue I would almost be able to see past it...but it is far from the only issue with the game.1. Constant hackers in Crucible, Gambit, and Trials. Bungie says they are working on this but the fix never comes.2. Bugs, bugs everywhere! With every update almost we are treated to \"What has Bungie broke this week?\" On good weeks items dont randomly disappear from our vaults...on bad weeks this is not the case.3. Network and server issues have run rampant since Bungie left Activision and contracted with whatever budget ass server company they moved the game to. I guess thats what you get when you go for the lowest possible bidder.4. Disrespecting the players seems to be what Bungie likes to do best. It sure as hell isnt fixing their game. I dont know how many times theyve told us \"Were listening\" and done the exact opposite of what weve been saying. This, or they just ignore us completely in favor of whichever Youtuber is swinging from their nuts that week.Avoid this game like the plague.", "Author": "KatanOmega", "Hours": 1219.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 7, 2020", "Review": "amazing game thanks bungie", "Author": "MikeRiz", "Hours": 1861.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: April 20, 2020", "Review": "i hate it I love itI hate it I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 love it", "Author": "ChrisBtw\u30b7", "Hours": 1451.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: April 15, 2020", "Review": "Space Rhinos!", "Author": "Pixel", "Hours": 2381.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 20, 2020", "Review": "I love this games PVP and raids.

PvE has run dry of content in the past 2 seasons and its just copy pastes of different activities that were already pre existing and just got a fresh coat of paint then called something \"new\" Im ashamed to say I supported this game by buying the DLCs and their season passes at the start of each DLC, theyre just not worth it in the grand scheme of things overall from what weve seen, the only \"fun\" DLC weve had was forsaken cause it had a decent length raid with a moderate-large amount of pve content to run through and do/enjoy for all, since then its been a downhill run of dry spells with nothing new and enjoyable to do, I dont want to say Bungie has lost their touch but theyre damn well close to it. On the PvP side of the matter; weve got no signs of a working anticheat, in its place we have a \"report system\" that Bungie neglects 90% of the time, cheaters run rampant in every gamemode, guns are overbalanced and become the easiest things in the world even a 2 year old could use them and drop high kills in a single game, some guns get nerfed into oblivion until the point where they arent viable again ever, 6v6 was never a good change, it couldve been one if they didnt throw all the small made for 4v4 maps into 6v6 map pools.This game has everything it needs to be amazing, Bungie just keeps glossing over it or skipping it completely, I want the game to succeed but it wont anytime soon or at all before the end of its lifecycle. Dont buy the DLC if you dont feel like wasting your time with dry spells every season. If youre new I only highly recommend Forsaken to you.

With the constant customization on ships, sparrows (a personal hovering vehicle that helps you get across the maps faster) armour and weapons the possibilities are endless.Destiny 2 features 9 destinations, 40 story missions, 54 adventures (Side Missions), 42 Lost Sectors (side area that contains a large number of enemies, a boss enemy, and an unlockable treasure chest), 17 Strikes (small 3 man missions to take down a boss that is causing disruption), 31 PvP maps, 12 one-off special or wave based activities (like Escalation Protocol, Menagerie, Reckoning, The Whisper or Zero Hour missions), 7 raids (6 man end game missions that require so much team work, consistent communication and repetition that give you some of the best loot in the game), 6 Gambit arenas, 3 Dungeons (mechanically challenging pinnacle activities similar to Raids), many, many quests, patrols, public events, and of course, thousands of associated rewards. All of that, plus hundreds of game systems which layer on top of that content, there has never been a better time to play this truely breathtaking game.Although PVE (Players vs Environment) is a main aspect, there is also PVP (Player vs Player) which is called Crucible, with several game modes that rotate in and out of the game every Tuesday you shall never be bored. There is also an competitive mode where only the best of the best play called Trials of Osiris, this Crucible event presided over by Saint-14 (an Exo and one of the most famous Titans in the history of The Last City), is an endgame Crucible mode first introduced by the House of Wolves expansion in D1. It is available every weekend, from Friday to the weekly reset on Tuesday. It returned to Destiny 2 during Season of the Worthy. This is where you show off your skills that you have gathered over your PVP and PVE journey.Gambit is another multiplayer game type introduced in Destiny 2: Forsaken. It is run by The Drifter, a rogue Guardian. This mode is a hybrid PVP/PVE mode that features two teams of four as they compete across three rounds. During the match, teams can summon blocker enemies, as well as teammates, to the other teams arena. You also have Gambit Prime which was introduced in Destiny 2: Season of the Drifter. It takes the classic Gambit mode and adds more strategy. Its a snappier game mode that promotes team play. Gambit Primes role system enhances that strategy.If you are looking for one of the best feeling first person shooter / massively multiplayer online role-playing games out this generation, look no further, this is it! no other game has brought me back time and time again like Destiny. This game seriously has infinite replay value, solid gunplay, 3 different character classes with a bunch of builds you can experiment with. This game subtly tackles multiple genres (first person shooter, third person shooter, hack n slash, platforming, racing) and does them better than some games that focuses on the one genre. The game did start off bumpy at launch, but with the amazing community this game has, splitting with publisher Activision and the incredible devs at Bungie, it has evolved drastically through the years and is an ever evolving game, it can only get better and better. Now that it is free to play, why not give it a go? right now is the best time to jump into Destiny 2.

Sometimes to the extent of being to much.- Addicting if there is something you really want. - The shooting aspect of the game is really solid when it comes to both audio and visuals - Everything you can buy with in game currency is cosmetic only. So even though its a F2P, they dont rely on P2W- There are also alot of different game modes such as Gambit and Vanguard.- Cons- You can complete the game solo but you will not be able to enjoy all the content. There are certain guns you wont be able to get and so on.- BUGS, do I have to say much more- They throw alot of content on you in the beginning and it can be really confusing. Sometimes you dont know where to start.- Things I dont know where to put (because they are pretty personal)- The game is really grindy. If you want a certain item you might have to do things over and over again, and sometimes that includes at specific times. For me thats not really a problem but I can see people not liking that aspect of the game.- When you have created a character you cant change the look. Just something to be aware of (cus I had no idea, and now I look stupid).- To be able to play all the content that they offer you will have to buy the Forsaken and Sadowkeep expansions (I played the free version for well over 100h and i had still plenty to do so you wont run short).- Final thoughtsDestiny 2 is a really good game. Lots of content and things to explore and just like every game it has its flaws, but I would deffinatly recommend it if you like a grindy game with a good community. The only thing i would recommend tho is to get into a clan or play with friends to be able to enjoy the entire game.

The gunplay is smooth and satisfying, the weapons are fun to play and use, and the character and world design is great. Ever since I started playing Destiny 2 as a New Light, I havent found another FPS game that matches the gunplay of Destiny 2. The worlds are detailed and fun to explore. Its fun running into other players and jumping up and down or emoting, then crouch spamming and going on their way. As a new light player in the beginning, the first year of Destiny 2 was amazing. Each of the seasons felt fresh and the loot felt new and worth grinding for. However, now in 2020 and 2021, Destiny 2 is ultimately stale and has not innovated or attempted to change. Each season is the following: \"Repeat a 3 player or 6 player event to get season currency. Use season currency to buy bonuses for the player event to get even more season currency. Do this for tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 until you unlock all the tiers.\"Even now, Destiny 2 is bringing back old exotics and old raids (cough cough, old recycled content) from Destiny 1. Ive never played Destiny 1, so I dont have that \"nostalgic\" factor to returning, reused content. In the past, they vaulted (hint: deleted) the \"Scourge of the Past\" raid (EDZ), the Leviathan raids, and the Calus raids -- meaning that there were NO more free raids for free-to-play users. Instead, they added \"Vault of Glass\", a raid from Destiny 1 which had a power requirement. By the next expansion, theyre going to remove the  Forsaken campaign (and eventually the Last Wish raid, we all know this will happen).After the Tangled Shore map is removed, its inevitable that the Dreaming City is next. After all, it \"served its purpose\" in Destiny 2 lore and Bungie will rather take content away from players. Content that we paid for. I do not consider Destiny 2 to be a MMO because it takes content that I paid for away from me. For example, look at Guild Wars 2, an actual MMORPG. The expansions are giant maps, but ArenaNet doesnt delete the \"expansion\" to make room for its new expansion. Ultimately, Destiny 2s decision to delete content that I paid for and their direction of re-using recycled, old content is stale and dry. When Bungie first \"sunset\", they removed maps and weapons. In a recent season, they added the weapons back and said \"new weapons!\" but in reality, they were the \"sunset\" weapons that they decided to bring back because \"sunsetting\" loot was the worst concept Ive ever heard of on a loot-based game.I didnt want to write this review. I spent countless late nights with friends on raids and grinding for loot and I enjoyed a lot of it. The gunplay is amazing and its fun to play. I even bought a pre-build PC just so I could play this game instead of using GeForce Experience.However, with the direction Destiny 2 is now taking, I cannot recommend this game for new or existing players any longer. After the first year of gameplay, you already experienced everything Destiny 2 will have to offer because Bungie refuses to innovate with new gameplay mechanics or loot (weapons and armor). Instead, Bungie will take assets, weapons, and raids from Destiny 1 and recycle it into Destiny 2.Thanks Destiny 2 for all the good times, but Im moving on...-- Old Review at 378 hours --Ive never played Destiny 1, but I found that this game is great!

While the story has definitely picked up more in the second game in general, I also feel like Bungie is really getting to put all their own decisions into the game.

The setting, the characters, and even the design of some weapons remind us of each other. The story is remarkable, all characters bring depth the game, but, I recommend you searching lore if you deep diving type... theres lot going on in destiny 1 that doesnt explain clearly in 2 \"obvious reasons\".With infinte replay factor that goes unnoticed at first, due difficulty all players encounter as soon as they complete story mode \"LFG\". The game has no matchmaking for ending game events like Raids and Dungeons, so I strongly recommend if you dont have 5 friends to play with, your first step is to find a guild.Dont be afraid to change guilds, the game doesnt punish you 4 that. There are many many guilds active in the moment soo yu can chose with who you wants to play! Playing with boring guys will make your game boring too. Raids can be very enjoying as it cannot be.On Bungie website you can search various guilds or also through social networks like facebook or twitch. People who play destiny for a long time like to help noobs but dont abuse it, whenever you have any questions, search on google or youtube first, the internet is full of good guides to make your game easier, since destiny doesnt fully explain quests.PROS:PVP similar to call of duty BO2, nice and fluid movimentation, no p2w (pay to win) Only cosmetics and dlcs. All OP itens you can find in standard game. Soo its just RNG or quest related weapons, BUT you can buy Exotic items from Xur \"Baro Kiteer feelings\". Its very hard to find someone hacking in PVP atm soo, this can be the best free to play game on steam ;)the cooperative systems reminds me ps2 classic \"Dark Watch\" We cant be revived in a Darkness Zone because the Darkness has a strong presence there, which weakens our light ! There are some areas where the Darkness is at its strongest, usually areas that arent public to all Guardians. If it gets strong enough, it probably strains your Ghosts Light.The graphics are amazing, I can run 60 fps with the highest setting in 1080p resolution using a poor gtx 970, my only problem is streaming in scenarios with many particles and creatures, because sometimes my FPS can vary between 40-45.

So Destiny 2, it is fun game a quick summary would be follow as so, elitist raid groups, fun PvP with good gun play but low server tick rate, Free to play people are honestly locked out from what started to get this game back on its feet, and lastly, there is so much PvE content to do even without the DLC.                   That is my general idea of this game and it might vary from person to person but, now that I am past that I want to go into the Pros and Cons of this game.  Cons  1. New SOLO players will  have a hard time getting into the community. A way around this is very simple but can be intimidating for some. On Discord there is a  Destiny 2 LFG [discordapp.com] community that has people willing to help but it can be hard to find some people for things like raids. If you have a friend or two that is new to the game then you guys can easily setup for nightfalls and raids will be similar situation just less wait time because there are more of you. and lastly if you have a friend(s) who have been playing for a while, you can learn a lot of the things you will have to from them.2. PvP has issues and I will try my best to address all of them, one toxicity exists like most games with a competitive edge. This toxicity comes in wide range of forms from, the person is using some sort of BM emote to try and tick you off or people leaving the game because \"my team is bad\"- Striker Titan with One Eyed Mask or \"Cant carry my team hard enough\" Golden Gun hunter running Celestial Nighthawk(dont do that please) or \"You guys suck, play around my rift and we win!\" Warlock with Lunafaction Boots. In all yeah it exists and it sucks.            The other thing that sucks about PVP is the low tick rate and advantage people with a high ping get. So the tick rate is rather awkward in Destiny 2 and leads to a variety of weird shots, this combined with target acquisition leads to inflated  head-shot hit boxes, but to be honest this is the least of your problems.              The bigger problem goes into people with high ping, two things can happen people will get randomly disconnected and or the worst is they teleport around having free reign over the map because you cant get a direct shot on them. It sucks when you have these issues.3. I know PVP was long but it does have a lot of issues but, we are past that now. I will now go into some more technical stuff. can you run Destiny 2 on low end computers yes to certain extent but if you are wondering that why not just look at the minimum specifications. In a much more serious tone I want to address this because I have had friends affected by it and it still happens, that is the cheat detection. Bungies cheat detection software is  SUPER  Sensitive, and when you are banned it is final unless they see it as a mistake which honestly only happens from time to time. A list of programs you should avoid having open are as follows, if it puts an overlay on the game, has any sort of \"injection code\",  or makes a graphical change WHILE you are in game, Virus protection software, and live background programs. Now their are certain exceptions to this and sadly I do not know the full list. 4. This game has some balance issues in both PvE and PvP, so in PvP it is more of an issue (One Eyed Mask I am looking at you even after the nerf) and other items like Thousand Voices being a raid weapon that is busted and some groups want you to have that when you might not. this one is short because a lot of games have balancing issues and I dont want to be a broken record.5. Last thing I want to say in the cons is Eververse, this is the big problem that has existed since the beginning of Destiny 2 and has remained, luckily Eververse is not pay to win any more but still is predatory with the purchases for how much you have to pay for the cosmetics, luckily you have the power of weekly bounties that give you bright dust and let you buy certain weekly rotating cosmetic items. My thoughts on the season pass is just get deluxe you will save money in the long run compared to buying the seasons with Silver. if you arent worried about cosmetics then you will survive, if you do, there are some free ones you can get here and there but there are not many.  Pros 1. There is a lot of content, even for new players, and buy just buying Forsaken you get one of the most expansive end games that has ever existed in Destiny. you have exotic quests raids, and with people who buy the DLC will have plenty of content and an easier time going up in light levels.2. The good side of the community exists and is very open to teaching new players and is a lot of fun when you play with these people even after you have learned most of the things, it just leads to more funny moments of doing your first raid and finishing it. I can say personally that when I did my first raid way back I had a great time and felt amazing when I finished, so overall the good side of the community is great!3. This is a pro for me maybe not for others but grinding in this game never truly ends, you can always get a weapon with a better roll or masterwork, there is always the Competitive Pinnacle weapon(now Ritual) there is also a Gambit and Strike ones that exist. Some items are collectible and acts as a mile stone for how long you have been playing and over all grinding for the best gear for your play style is always fun for me but, I understand not all will enjoy it.4. There really is no one set way to play a class, while yes there is a best or most efficient way to play, but you dont have to if you want to. I personally play Nova Warp Blink with Astrocyte Verse warlock in PVP while others will go for Nezarecs Sin or something else. All that matters is you play the way you want to play and while others might say wow what are you doing, it is nice to encounter someone that says hey that is really interesting. So thinking outside the box in this game is always fun and I personally recommend it5. The last thing I want to say is the lore, this is one of my favorite parts of this game, the lore goes so far and was put into the game while somethings from Destiny 1 were cut out such as the Exo Stranger we have been given so much lore that is in the world itself as scan items or logs you get in the triumphs, I recommend that if you want to get into it watch some channels on youtube such us  My name is Byf  who is someone I watch from time to time to try and figure something out.  Final Thoughts So overall Destiny 2 is story about you becoming legend and pushing yourself to go beyond what you thought was possible and once you push through the early game grind you will find so many doors open up. So what I have to say is if you decide to play this game and give it a try then, eyes up guardian.", "Author": "Professor Vex", "Hours": 1536.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 14, 2019", "Review": "after a 1000 hours on blizzard and now more on steam IF YOURE A FAN OF HALO OR LIKE VERY CASUAL SHOOTERS  id reccomend picking this up f2pif youre more on the hardcore side and have atleast 5 other friends that are willing to shell out cash id reccomend getting shadowkeep and forsaken for the raids otherwise the shooting feels great (theres bullet magnnetism so if youre a no assist eletist you might hate it)theres plenty pve content to keep you busy for atleast 50 hours and if youre a completionist even more pvp is dodgy as theres a few outlyer weapons that just make it very unpleasantTHERES GAMBIT ITS OK BUT IT GETS OLD theres raids they require actual communication and coordination and can be really fun", "Author": "Smoky Levante", "Hours": 653.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 14, 2019", "Review": "This game is loads of fun and pretty addicting and has gotten boring at times but if you have both expansions there is a lot of content on the surface and with the base game and the expansions there is a lot of deep lore and exploration and quest to find and complete.", "Author": "Shmitty2808", "Hours": 2589.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 11, 2019", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "[EASY] sj", "Hours": 46.0}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 8, 2019", "Review": "Thias game is absolutely TRASH", "Author": "Big penis man", "Hours": 320.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 6, 2019", "Review": "Shoot the aliens.

The majority of the lore that will help you figure out what the story is, is well, tied to equipment or achievements. What this means is unless you really know what you want to learn about then you have to LOOK. Which to some might be a positive. If you want a quick rundown on the story here it is: Your a dead person brought back to life by the ghosts (little robot eye guy) and they were made by the traveler (big white thing floating above the city thats a living being but also maybe not?!) Its set way into the future where humanity already went through an apocalypse. Oh and we found lots of Alien species that we as the newely resurrected \"guardians\" must defend the rest (honestly only one human city left on earth OOF) of humanity from them. Now onto the rest of negatives:Oh and bad content updates in the past could be an issue in the future, the first two dlcs werent great. I got back into this game only after Forsaken came out.

You can also look to /r/Fireteams or the Destiny mobile app to find people to play with.In terms of free content, the first three campaigns are unlocked - The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind. You also have access to all strikes (replayable mini-missions), PvP and PvEvP maps and modes, and all 9 planets/destinations. Additionally there are three raids available - Leviathan, Spire of Stars, and Eater of Worlds. These are challenging but fun 6-man activities that require a lot of coordination and skill to beat.

So far when those public events on the maps happen, when I die, I dont have to travel far, just far enough that enemies are not after me as soon as I spawn.

Im going to judge the game off of the previous expansions that Ive spent hundreds of hours playing on my Xbox up to Forsaken and what Ive seen of the moon so far.If you like story driven games with both action and lore, youre sure to love the almost apocalyptic vibe from Destiny 2. Each enemy is distinctly different from the last, with their own way of attacking and defending. The bosses are challenging enough to make you want to keep trying without just throwing in the towel to the intensity. The game itself is just stunning to look at, with views you cant get many other places. Theres nothing quite like the stunning Vex-infested world Nessus or  the rocky scenery of the moon Io. Each area (I was going to call them planets but not all of them are planets) feel so different and feel so much fun to explore.Theres the other thing: The words are packed with content (some more than others). I once spent a good couple of hours just walking around Nessus, looking for fun secrets or easter eggs; hunting for lost sectors, finding rare loot, just taking in the scenery. If thats not your style, and youre into grinding, then youre very much in luck.Destiny 2 has a grindy aspect that usually isnt required but is still fun to do. Leveling up your Guardian to get to bigger and tougher areas takes something that seems like it would be infuriating and makes it so much fun.This game also has some fantastic activities to work towards for endgame. Hi, Shalom on November 10th, 2020 here. Beyond Light is currently installing so I decided to write about my experiences with raids past, present, and future. Theyre fun and challenging, a joy to learn, and great to do with friends. While they removed the easier raids that werent played as much, theyre bringing back Vault of Glass for all of my D1 folks and adding a new Raid that drops on November 21st, 2020, I believe: The Deep Stone Crypt. For those that dont know Destiny lore, its the mysterious location where exos were created. No one has been since the Golden Age. Seeing the lore shape out in this new expansion is fantastic.The games only like 50-60 gigs now. Download it. Try it. Become legend.While this game did have issues in the past (Activision, absolutely wack game devs), theyve been fixed for the most part and Destiny 2 is finally evolving into something beautiful and fun to play. Theyve set out the foundation for a wonderful story thats going to be ever-expanding, so if you havent yet, you should start playing soon.This is getting a little lengthy, so lets go over everything it has:Adventure? Yes.Action? Yes.An ever evolving, well written story? Yes.A little grindy? Sometimes, but its still fun.PvP? Yes. (The Crucible is such a treat.)Beautiful landscapes? Yes.Is the game challenging? Yes.TL;DR: The game is fun. Its free.

I have been playing it from alpha/beta days of Destiny 1 and its truly amazing to watch it grow and evolve into the fun experience it is now.The eternal battle between Light and Darkness, the twists and turns and overall story has improved tremendously over time. Even though there is still ways to improve quite a bit on that storytelling people like me who have been playing the game from inception have followed all the stories and lore so its a bit easier to keep track of all the characters and happening in the Destiny Universe. However, dont let this turn you away from the game. Destiny has some of the most satisfying gun play among the AAA games. The abilities and cinematic encounters and looter grind rarely gets mind-numbing because of it. If you are new to Destiny and want to start it out, you will experience a fairly good community and a lot of helpful guardians you can play with. The way the game is designed for the most part can be played solo if you are lone wolf, but the best experience will always be with 2 or more friends. Sure you might not be able to experience truly stunning end-game content like raids being solo but LFG community is pretty strong.Being Bungies first foray into looter shooter genre, over the years they have created some truly mesmerizing and memorable moments for me. They are still learning and evolving and sometimes they hit it out of the park and sometimes seasons get boring and downright infuriating. PvE aspect of the game is extremely entertaining and yes you will grind (thats the part of any looter shooter) but PvP is also a lot of fun. You will hear Destiny community complaining a lot about PvP (including myself) but this really comes from the fact that they have not grown PvP in features and evolving it like they did PvE and of course the cheating is the most prevalent problem however overall PvP experience is pretty satisfying when you have those rare matches when there are no cheaters. Hopefully Bungie takes these problem seriously and deals with it because PvP can be actually a lot of fun too even for casual players. NEGATIVES:- As an ever-growing game and world Destiny has had its share of bad seasons and when Bungie made mistakes. This will undoubtedly still happen but for all this time Bungie has been improving on it quite and they overall end up bringing the goods. When I say mistakes I mean choices of sunsetting weapons, armors or creating very few content additions or activities that were clearly not thought through properly and becomes very boring very quickly. Fortunately for all of us, this really gets correct usually fairly quickly so overall experience continues to be fun.- PvP = cheating is pretty bad and anti-cheat and new solutions is seriously needed. Bungie needs to do better here. With the new massive expansion news for Bungie as corporation it is still mind-boggling they havent taken this problem seriously.- PvP = they just barely started innovating and making the rewards from PvP a bit more \"rewarding\" but PvP has not really changed a lot in years unlike PvE. The most competitive modes in PvP are almost inaccessible to casual players because of the same rewards based problem and (cheating above) only attract the very top tier players which makes it a sweat fest all the time and what a lot of casuals simply dont want to experience. But the changes they are slowly making do seem promising so we are seeing some movement on that front.- Destiny is not a game you can join to play for an 30-40 mins and hop off. So dont go in expecting it to be. When you get sucked into Destiny universe you will definitely be spending hours and hours of your time in it. CONCLUSION:If you want to experience a pretty epic game, that has its own cinematic experience with awesome abilities and one of the best gunplay mechanics, you like looter shooter genre, like to experience some epic moments in raids and like the space/sci-fi vibe in games with the narrative of light vs darkness, Destiny is without a doubt a game for you. You will have a blast.Feeling like the powerful light Guardian fighting Darkness to save the universe and humanity has never been embodied better. If you are a PvP Halo type player, you will still have a blast in PvP however this is their weak point at the moment. Trials of Osiris is the top tier end game content for PvP players and they just started truly making it rewarding. Overall I dont play a ton of games, maybe a couple I play and Destiny is almost one that I play exclusively. And even though I did take breaks as you will, Destiny is still one of the most immersive and fun games Ive played.

Firstly, the graphics are amazing, well atleast, they are in my opinion. As well as that, the game itself is not TOO high spec and has a wide variety of graphical options to choose from, I have also seen some people comment that the game is fine to play at 30fps (havent played at this low myself however, so cant fully confirm) Another thing I really love about this game is the characters in it, Destiny 2 is an MMO, but voice acting and good character design make all the characters in the game feel really lovable, each character also has a wide range of lore for those who wish to read up on it, but thats not compulsory.In terms of gameplay, the game is really fun to play if your a fan of MMOs, Shooters or both, there are 3 distinct classes that each have their own abilities and skills, you can choose to have a character of each class if you so desire, but if you are playing casually, I dont think it is neccessary. There are a wide variety of weapons in the game too, and in my opinion, fighting enemies and bosses can be extremely fun. As well as this, there are a variety of different gamemodes, including PvP in th game.My one major criticism of the game is that at times, there can be a LOT of grinding, while personally I dont mind the amount of grinding, it can definitley become boresome at times. For example, to get certain Exotic weapons (the highest tier of weapon in the game) you may have to spend ages killing enemies in PvE or PvP. I personally dont mind this grinding as it is satisfying to me to get the reward, but for some people, this may not be the case. Personally, I would reccomend Destiny 2, if your unsure, I would definitley reccomend giving it a try now, there are currently multiple campaigns in the game, however some of these will be removed in a few months.Please ignore all my spelling mistakes, I really cant be bothered to go and change all of them :)Tldr; yeah its kinda good, bit grindy but good, try it, warlocks best class", "Author": "Caleb", "Hours": 322.4}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 16, 2019", "Review": "I sadly cant quite recommend this for newcomers.

Skip to the end for a tl;dr if needed)Amazing game, Ive played since it launched on BNET and started in D1. Im gonna try and break down the game for any new players, or some of you that might want some extra insight.The gist of this game is a FPS loot and shoot grind. You are a guardian of the last city on earth and can outfit yourself with endless types of guns and armor on your quest to keep the city safe.But before we dive in, lets cover the basics: Choosing Your Character You can choose between 3 races as well as 3 character types. These are very similar to most MMORPG characters: - Hunter (Lone wolf, high damage super, great add clear supers) - Titan (The tank, great supportive supers, and decent add clear supers) - Warlock (The healer, great supportive super, medium damage super, and decent add clear supers)You are allowed to have 3 characters on your account (all three will be accessible to play from the title screen) and after creating 3 you will have to delete one to create anotherAll characters are good for solo/team play and it is a personal preference. With this being said, some endgame activities require a combination of different characters for optimal performance. (I will get into it more further on) Choosing Your Characters Class Looking at the list above you might be thinking supers? What the hell are those? Supers are what you call your class. Each of the 3 character types has 3 different classes focused around the 3 elements in game; these being  Void ,  Arc , and  Solar .I dont want to bore you to death with even more of my mediocre writing, so if you want to go into detail about classes and subclasses check out this  Website [d2.destinygamewiki.com], they do a very good job:  Story Progression Moving on, there are many campaigns from previous expansions. These are: - The Red War  (The Cabals assault on the tower)  - Curse of Osiris  (Finding Osiris and helping him)  - Warmind  (Finding Anna Bray and helping her)  - Forsaken  (Helping Cayde, and a revenge story)  - And now Shadowkeep  (Finding Eris and helping her) (I included a mostly spoilerless description of the campaign, but look at your own risk)These should be your go to as you level your character and get to know the game. Casual Play As you continue the story, there are other opportunities to play and progress. These are known as the Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit playlists: - Vanguard: This is a PVE playlist where you can choose between heroic story missions, strikes, and nightfalls (nightfalls are a harder version of strikes, and The Ordeal nightfall is an endgame activity.)  Strikes being the only matchmade activity  aside from the first two difficulties of The Ordeal. - Crucible: This is a PVP playlist where you will go up against other players in various game modes of your choice. You can use  titan because it is broken  any of the guns and abilities in your arsenal to win and secure the bread. There is also a ranked playlist that you can compete for glory and pursue pinnacle quest weapons. - Gambit: This is a PVPVE playlist where a team of 4 matchmade/fireteam guardians will compete to summon and kill a boss before the other team. To summon the boss, you will need to bank X amount of motes and fend off invaders. The amount of motes depends on the type of gambit you are playing, whether it be normal  Gambit [destiny.fandom.com] or  Gambit Prime [www.destinypedia.com]. Endgame As you progress through the world of Destiny 2 you might find that the story is great, but you want to find something amazing and more challenging. This is where the endgame comes in, and is undoubtedly the best part of the game (opinion).There are many endgame activities like dungeons, Nightfalls (The Ordeal), etc. But for the sake of this Im just going to talk about raids.Raids are a challenging activity that have a team of 6 guardians traversing a new area undergoing new challenges. These raids are not match made, and  will require communication  (preferably through a mic & headset).These challenges include: - New bosses with new mechanics - Encounters with jumping puzzles - Sparrow races (One raid in particular) - There are also secret chests in some raids that will require traversing dangerous paths to reach.These raids are made up of different encounters consisting of the above challenges. Every encounter will reward loot, with non boss encounters dropping non powerful loot.To beat these encounters players will need to use a combinations of  buffs and debuffs [destiny.fandom.com]. These will increase the potency of your weapon damage, health, shield and regen. Many different combinations will be better for different situations, so don\u2019t be afraid to learn as you go or ask some fellow guardians.But not all players will have 5 friends on standby for raids, and that\u2019s where LFG (or looking for game) servers come in. There are many out there but the   discord server [discord.gg] is a great option. Tl;dr There are many different ways to play destiny and customise your character. The story (the beginning kinda sucks, also my opinion) is a great way to get started, and after you progress there are other activities like Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit. After all of this if you are up for a challenge check out some of the dungeons, raids and The Ordeal.If you are planning on becoming a regular on Destiny, there are many different resources you can use to increase QoL. Im leaving a few below and feel free to join my discord server if you need some additional information.

I will talk about story, presentation, gameplay and loot.When talking about story I think its important to identify what the setting of the lore is. This game isnt sci-fi, its genre is better described as \"Space Weirdoes\", you get your space ships and energy weaponry you expect from sci-fi but you also get characters speaking in flowery grandiose language and rocking robes over power armor and ridiculous face tattoos. This isnt necessary a bad thing in itself, W40k does \"Space Weirdoes\" very well but it is a bad thing in this game.The thing is, the campaign is garbage tier, its boring as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. I genuinely tried to give it a fair go but after 5 hours I realised that I really dont care, dont care about the lore, the characters, anything. This is supposed to be some dire situation with humanity down to its last city but nothing in the game communicates any sense of impending doom or urgency. I have given up and just went to do strikes and activities and luckily they are quite fun.The presentation in this game is fantastic, the graphics are great and it runs silky smooth on my 1080 on 1440p. The level design is good and has a decent amount of variety. One small complaint is that enemy design is weird for weirdness sake, the enemies look impractical in terms of how a combat unit should look.Gameplay is where this game shines. Most of the weapons feel very good to use with excellent aural and visual feedback. Movement is excellent. The enemies use cover and many will attempt dart out of the line of fire which makes for good shooting. One complaint I have is that some pistols and pulse rifles feel unsatisfying to use in terms of aural feedback. Also, bosses are quite bulletspongy that thats par of course for looter-shooters and I dont have any exotics yet.In terms of loot, I cant talk too much but I am a bit disappointed with legendaries in this game. They dont feel special like BL2 legendaries do, they just feel like stronger weapons in class. Having said that, I havent picked up any exotics yet so I will reserve final judgement on loot. One big positive is that you have 500 inventory in bank, one would think that big inventory space would be a given in loot centric games but BL3 comes saddled with a pathetic 50 Bank space.", "Author": "Anticitizen 1", "Hours": 13.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: July 2, 2020", "Review": "(Read updates)I have over 1100 hours in D2 and have been playing it since its launch on Battle.net.6/2/2020: I would have given this game a positive review had this review been made a year ago before Bungies separation from Activision. The quality of the content added to D2 since the separation from Activision has gone down substantially. In year 2 of D2 we received a new dungeon, a secret mission, an entire new major game mode, 3 raids, major story content, 2 new zones, 2 incredibly well made and repeatable PvE modes, new challenge weapons every month, and plenty of unique and interesting weapons that were almost entirely composed of new models. In year 3 of D2, we have received a new dungeon, 1 raid, a reused zone with updated models (from D1), PvE modes that range from lackluster and lazily made to surprisingly well made (not that they matter because all of them have been removed), recycled weapons from previous years in Destiny 2 /D1, recycled armor from D1, and a shell of a highly desired gamemode from Destiny 1 plagued by cheaters and a worse barrier to entry than seen in D1 (Trials). D2s Y1/Y2 added new weapons and armor to drop pools every season to make the game worth grinding and playing to get cool loot. Now in Y3, most loot is recycled from year 1/2 or from D1. Bungies effort in creating an amazing game has gone completely down the drain. In addition to everything stated about Destinys terrible year 3 execution, weve learned recently that all the weapons and armor you had fun or worked hard grinding for and enjoyed using will be made useless going forward. Dont believe the people saying that you can still use them, just not in high end content. This is a fallacy, all new content added to D2 in year 3 has had a light level requirement higher than the previous cap of the prior season. It wasnt so bad when you think about how you can use your old guns in vanguard strikes, old raids, crucible, and open world zones. Unfortunately Bungie is one step ahead of you and will be removing almost half of the strikes, all of the quest content in those zones, all the quests/unique loot in those zones, and all of the old raids except for LW and GoS (so they can still sell Forsaken and Shadowkeep). Overall take: Bungie is not capable of making a game without a publisher. Their vision for their game will destroy it.  A tragic fall of a video game giant and I can only hope that they change course drastically before their name is tarnished forever just to be remembered as the company that made Halo.Update 11/10/2020: Beyond Light has truly ruined the game. Making it a substantially worse experience for new and veteran players alike. This game has good gunplay and story, but Bungie is driving it into the ground as fast as possible.Update: 3/1/2021: Bungie removed sunsetting of all weapons from Season 10 and onwards (anything before S10 is still unusable at a reasonable power level). Grinding for new weapons feels good once again. Trials is still an awful place and Bungie is currently adding recycled content from D1 to the game. A new secret dungeon (similar to Whisper/Zero Hour) has been added and is very pretty. The new perks being added feel interesting and fun. I still cant recommend this game, but Bungie may be starting to turn it around.Update: 6/24/2021: I can finally recommend this game again. New perks are good, PvE activities added are fun.

Almost no truly new content has been released since Forsaken, which is the only good content D2 has ever seen. Bungie continues to quietly milk the playerbase dry while they work on other projects, instead of focusing their efforts genuinely on D2 like they promised. Bungie is in it for the money and their games will continue to suffer in quality as more and more of their time is spent on finding ways to get to peoples wallets without providing anything new for them to experience. Bungie, as a company, are a total joke. Like EA, they should be viewed as entirely worthless, greedy devs who have no real passion or interest in videogames. The sooner people stop giving them money, the sooner they might actually be forced to put any effort into the garbage theyve been shoveling out for the past decade. Destiny 2 is one of the most thoroughly un-enjoyable experiences you could subject yourself to. There is no aspect of the game that is in any way fun or engaging. Bland combat with uninteresting abilities on long cooldowns, the same 3 factions of enemies Destiny has been re-using since the released of D1, extreme recycling of mechanics and encounters, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 UI that hasnt been improved once in 3 years, and a core gameplay loop designed to waste the players time with monotonous chores. Everything in Destiny 2 is a grind without the reward. You grind for an arbitrary level cap which gets raised so regularly, despite its total meaninglessness, that theres no real point of even keeping up. Otherwise, theres nothing of value to grind for. Everything good or enjoyable gets nerfed, every new item is the same, every armor piece looks worse than the one youve got on. Id recommend playing almost anything you could think of over this failed abortion of a game, at least a truly awful game could be fun in its absurdity, where-as D2 is so unremarkable and bland that it simply sucks all joy from every second you experience of it.

Once you do, it opens into the more \"open world choose your actions\" sort of play style.Do not play for PVP unless you are willing to farm for good PVP weapons.Do not play if you do not like very repetitive farming (MMO style).Wait for DLC to go on sale on Holidays (they go upwards of 60% off). If you wait for it oh my word is it worth it, especially beyond light.Save your bright dust for super specific items in the bright dust store. Lets you get cool Holiday event armor even without having to pay real money.Play with someone who knows the game and is good at teaching the game. The game has gone through a lot of changes and has an honestly horrible tutorial right now that is super duper long right now, and was meant for the first Destiny.If you want to try a class, get that class high in power level (1320 ish and above), and it will skyrocket new characters of different classes in the future, allowing you to play any of the three classes after a while. You have to do the super long tutorial again.Make sure you look into what the different types of special champions are in later difficulties. It is a more interesting part of the game when you have to deal with barrier champions, overcharge champions, etc.Otherwise super super fun to me and I could sync tons and tons of hours into this game easy, even before I had the DLC.

Theres so much content, so many new guns, the power grind feels rewarding to partake it, and theres never been a better time to dive headfirst back into the game. I was having a hard time figuring out what games to play so when I heard Witch Queen released I bought it and told myself \"Were getting addicted to this game\" and as you can see with my \"107+ hrs in the last two weeks\" its needless to say that I have. I felt overwhelmed with my current character so I started fresh and did something Ive never done before, make a titan. I started and beat the new campaign on legendary with a default sentinel titan and some exotics that I happened to pick up ages ago (I had 300+ hours when this game was still on the BattleNet client). The challenge was so rewarding to finally conquer and the loot I got in return was equally fulfilling. For those of you worried about not having people to play with Id highly recommend finding a clan! Having a small group of people to play with really makes the experience of D2 much more enjoyable. I used to be a squeaky little 14 year old in D1 so I ended up soloing all the raids I could but as I recently got back into the game I stumbled upon someone and after some talking asked to join their clan. I can confidently say that being apart of a clan encourages you to play more, allows you to have a better time, and overall increases your QoL in the game substantially. TLDR: This game just got hit with a new wave of fun, even more fun if you manage to find people to play with (with shouldnt be that hard with LFG servers on Discord).

If youre looking for a game that takes you to an amazing looking destinations to meet up with some peaceful alien species only to find out that their not friendly at all and get your back smacked by a friendly guardians sword falling down to hungry packs of scary hive ogres and exploding thralls to meet your fated heroic death LOL. In short its a fun game if your looking to do raids, PVP and enjoy some story elements on the side with your friends, but youll have to invest some money in it for the free to play experience isnt really worth it.Long review:Thats said, you need to keep in mind that over the years Bungie removed about 70% of the in game content. Leaving it in a real dry state for new players to enjoy. Its hard to get into the story without the main story actually being there. They removed about 5 Raids, 4 main destinations  and so many exotic quest. Now a days you can just buy these exotic guns from the tower. Not to mention that the grinding experience is a bit rough on the edges since youre expected to be at level 1100 right from the start. Thats literally the legendary gears level if you didnt know.For new players, I would highly recommend that you begin your journey by playing Forsakens DLC story missions. Youll find it in a place called the Tangled shore at the bottom right of the destinations screen. It should be for free right now, but its said that it will be removed soon. When you first start the game Bungie will drag you by the ear to Earths Fallens territory to show you around, so dont freak out. Just finish this mission and go play Forsaken. After you finish the main scenario, try playing Petras Quest titled \"Key of Light and Darkness\" and that will get you the Dreaming city unlocked. Spin around in the dreaming city for a little bit do some missions etc.. and then make your last Wish and go play the dreamings city raid xD. Thats if you have 5 other friends interested in it of course.You can later on play Shadow Keep and Beyond Light if you have them. Dont give Shadow Keep that much attention though. Its pretty much a copy pasted content from Destiny 1.After you finish their stories you can go and enjoy the end game content like Raids, Strikes, PVP ETC.I would like to also mention, that some of the seasonal content in the game might get you confused. You might see a guy who just died in the story, alive and well in front of you and I have no solution for that really.There is also the problem of the story content feels shallow some times, since Bungie made it so you can skip it if you want to. There is also the problem of having all Light subclass abilities unlocked from the start. They claimed that its for the best so new players would jump into the End Game right from the start, but what they did is actually killing the grinds fun. Just to grab the new players money.One final thing to mention. The game doesnt require a paid subscription in order to play, but expect them to rip-off your money else where. Like selling you a 25$ DLC that contains a dungeons and mediocre 2 exotic quest that doesnt justify the price at all. Talking about the 30th Anniversary DLC here. Youd say that you wont buy it, but youll end up buying it since it has an almost OP gun.And keep in mind that some of the content they sell \u2014which you might have just bought!\u2014 can just disappear into thin Air if Bungie wants it to.

Well note that soon (in witch queen) there will be a crafting system for our weapons. Cant wait to see what it will be like!PVE as PVP there are several levels of difficulty and you can feel a real progression when you are well surrounded you start to make a good stuff, to get good weapons, look at every little detail to min max your build, develop your game sense. If you are motivated and invested you can only progress and DAMN its satisfying to see yourself progress and be able to do more and more complicated things!For the PVP dont expect quality, the servers are still in the Middle Ages in peer to peer, the matchmaking is often not fair. But if you are patient and persistent the gameplay Destiny 2 offers is very satisfying, for example by landing multiple headshots with a sniper or winning a duel by baiting the enemys senses, bouncing a grenade off a wall to hit an opponent behind the cover and a lot of other cool stuff. For the lore enjoyer: the story of this game is deep, meticulous, every little detail, every little enigma, nothing is left to chance.However, reading and following the story can be complicated as you have to collect and search for every little detail in the game. Hopefully there are databases on the web and youtubers such as: My name is ByfMisc: third party websites make your experience on the game more fun, smooth and can give other objectives as well, here are some of them:  DIM [destinyitemmanager.com], https://bray.tech, https://www.light.gg,  raid.report [raid.report]For example my favourite activity in the game by far, are raids. Heres my  raid.report [raid.report]The website displays your record of all the raids you have done or left, they have a badge system and speedruns, completions ranking, between all players. (Worldwide ranking)Challenge seekers will be served: three man, two man or even solo raids that are normally done with 6 players. Finish them without any player dying, etc.At the end of the day, after more than 5k hours on this game, I havent managed to collect all triumphs, farm all godrolls of each weapons, main all characters with all subclass because Destiny is constantly evolving and that can be the biggest advantage as well as the biggest disadvantage at the same time.5k hours and I still havent stopped so what are you waiting for?I hope this has been helpful, most importantly have fun.", "Author": "Elijah.", "Hours": 5993.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 10, 2021", "Review": "a game but what is a game what is what i dont know what what brain dead", "Author": "Ricecakeintens", "Hours": 255.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 7, 2021", "Review": "I hate it.

Destiny 2 scratches an itch that other RPGs just dont at all. Its a good game with an extremely long grind time. PvP can be really fun and so can PvE. The D2 community is probably one of the chillest Ive seen in a PvP game. They are very willing to help you out with a lot of the content (granted a lot of it is being vaulted at the time of the post or is locked behind Bungies stupid paywalls) but if youre got the time and some of the money to invest into this game Id really suggest giving it a shot. I never really did any of the PvP content or hard PvE content cause I never had any friends to play it, but once I was able to get into the D2 community in streams. I was able to get my 1st ever flawless in Trials of Osiris and do my 1st ever Grandmaster Nightfall thanks to them. Dont think because some of the content is extremely hard that you cant do them. The community is there to help you out. Sounds like Im promoting here but, Id highly suggest checking out these streamers communities (Twitch.tv/Nuff, Mendezszn, AngelicaFTW and maii_style) They have very welcoming communities that are willing to help out and answer questions. Even myself Im more than happy to answer questions pertaining to D2 and to help out new light players(newbies) Sorry for the long review, I just love this game and hate this game at the same time.

Ive gotten to know the recent ups and downs for the past year, and honestly it was worth it!Loot Loot Loot, thats all youre going to get, I always love grinding for specific weapons to get god rolls, and when its in the meta, or theres a seasonal mod that combines with it, it brings in a whole lotta fun! As well as that, the environments the game offers are amazing to look at, I find myself just sitting around somewhere afk with some music in the background while I eat or just take a break.I witnessed the bumpy start to Beyond light, and its not so great first season, though that did change with season of the chosen and beyond, as they did a much better job in terms of gameplay, and story telling.

It got me into shooters, its story inspired my own writing, its lore has at times made me cry, and others made me feel brave inside, its music made me recognize just how beautiful music in general could be and lead to my current love of many different types of music at large, and through this game, I met some of the best friends I have ever known, digitally or in the real world both. This game, this franchise, this story, this community, while imperfect and with many major flaws, is from the bottom of my heart, amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone with an above-average PC and some time to spend to join us and become a Guardian.

Other important activities include 6 player Raids and Seasonal activities. Yes, It does have Seasons and Yearly DLC but... It is worth it. A good way of gaugeing it is: Price/Time Played. If the number is or will be less than 1. It is worth it. Lastly on the monetization, there is micro transactions as with every free game but they are purely cosmetic and not too aggressive. You can also get around this by earning a currency that has a rotation of cosmetics and is entirely free.One minor annoyance is that to access more competitive PvP modes, you have to either buy a DLC or verify yourself via phone. I have found that this is highly unreliable as the system to verify does not seem to work as intended and buying a season does not work either. However I understand that it is necessary to act as a speed bump to hackers or cheaters which are still a problem. Overall this is a superb game and one I will definitely continue playing.

Past tense of course. Now I dont care for it as much, as there are much better, enjoyable options out there. Here goes... The game environments and their graphics are truly beautiful, the ideas of the game play are good, the lore is second to none, albeit a little confusing without delving deeper into it. Many different activities make for a lot of choices for any level of looter/shooter gamer, noob or \"pro\". Other than that, this game really does disgust me. Why do I keep playing it? Well, to put it simply, its because Im insane. I keep going back thinking the game will improve - keep going back over and over each time expecting a different outcome. Thats insanity. Bungie could make this game the best ever, hands down. There are so many activities to choose from, PVP, PVE, Solo, teams, world first attempts that always draw a crowd... the list goes on. But they refuse to step up and change the game to balance for everyone unless one of their big streamers has a cry about something truly stupid - Heres looking at you Datto - screw you, I solo completed content that you said shouldnt be able to be soloed, post nerf. The only thing they do now is Nerf things, even though they said they wouldnt - white nail on whisper ring any bells?? Bungie for some unexplained reason, cannot get their heads around the fact that PVE and PVP are two completely different things, so if they need to nerf a weapon in PVE, it should only affect PVE, no difference for PVP. But no, never the case.They would rather focus their attention, and ultimately the player bases hard earned on stuff that truly does not matter at all, like game wide nerfing, recycled new gameplay (solstice EAZ again anyone?), cosmetics or a re-skin on a weapon no-one wants or even uses. Want that challenge completed? \"Go and kill 100 of this type of enemy in this location\"... Smart gamers would go do a strike or activity in that location to get those kills. Bungie comes in and says \"Nah fam, we will put you in a nearly completed strike so you dont get those required kills efficiently\". Then they put you in a packed server so you just simply find it impossible to get the required kills.... Its all about that boring, mind numbing grind for absolutely nothing of value. A good fix for this would be enabling players to choose whether they want matchmaking on or off for strikes, not forcing them to play how Bungo wants - inefficiently. Speaking of inefficient, shield mechanics in PVE - Raids, strikes etc. The way Bungo use them here is just flat out lazy programming. If they want you to not do damage to a boss, they could just remove them from the playable area, not leave them there completely shielded but still able to kill you. This is of course part and parcel of the Destiny franchise, but still, it makes no sense and part of their laziness is explained away by the lore. Also on the topic of laziness, the amount of bugs and glitches experienced during gameplay is extremely excessive, as though noone thinks to test and use the product before they throw it out to the community. Countless times they have basically shut down, rather than fix the problem with weapons or challenge completions. Anyone want to know whats killed more guardians in the history of Destiny than anything else in game? Simple, its \"the architects\". Then we have the PVP - Anyone that says its in a healthy state at the moment, has no credibility at all, as the matchmaking in this game is still the worst ever. It will match you against people very literally on the other side of the planet, because everyone loves lag right? Or if youre fortunate enough to get a good connection, expect to be kerb stomped by players that are clearly on a lot higher skill level than yourself. Very rarely will you get a game that the players are similar enough skill level and connected well enough to have a continually enjoyable PVP experience. The game has off the chart Aim Assist. When people mention Meta PVP weapons, all they mean is \"this weapon has excessive Aim Assist, use it\". There are no \"good\" PVP players in this game, there are only players that are really good at using the \"close enough is good enough to hit the \"hit box\" - aim assisted players. A game that relies on a programming to give certain weapons \"better aim\", is not a good game. Its offensive to anyone that knows that a normal computer game gun shot goes where you aim and fire it, but then you have a computer geek forcing their way in saying that they know better. This is why the competitive side of Destiny PVP will never be on the world stage. Any weekend, take a look at the amount of streamers doing content on Destiny compared to any major game title.... there is good reason for that. Then there are the hackers. Yes they are a big problem, hopefully the new BattlEye system will help, but its a big task.... Moving on from that, the game should be a very player friendly gaming experience, after all, youre running around with other guardians, or as my clan calls them - Space Morons, all over the place right? Well yeah... It can at times be a bit of a toxic community that is very quick to jump on people, whether in PVP or PVE. Elitism is a thing, if you dont keep up with the seasonal flip-flopping artefact, gotta have this weapon to participate silliness then its too easy to get left behind. In saying that, its kinda understandable, as this game will make you grind, and grind, and grind, and then grind some more to get god-roll gear, so who wants to waste time helping others? Try to find a clan that is helpful and friendly, yes its getting very difficult (mine is great), as the player base has dwindled so severely to the point that its really only no lifers or very very casual players, still playing and enjoying it. So getting help on end game content can be very difficult unless you are prepared to go to lfg. Bungie have sunset a lot of weapons and activities, so if you are a completionist, dont bother as you wont be able to get everything. If Bungie fixed a few things, it will be better. Fix the artefact - (overload, unstoppable and barrier champions? Glitches overpowering unintended things? So stupid) so you can at least adjust it on the fly, fix their completely broken PVP so people with potatoes as routers cant play, or at the very least, maintain a minimum ping to host (dare I say - dedicated servers??) Clean out the huge amount of cheating PVP accounts, get rid of the stupid game systems in place, such as raid tokens, stop the RNG gods from limiting peoples ability to keep up with the no lifers by removing aim assist from weapons in PVP, kill the shield mechanic for bosses, remove the raid revive token system, maybe have easy or normal, and hard raid difficulties, so at least content isnt locked for non hard core players? Average players should be able to still do content, and not get one shot by a normally easy enemy. For reference, I soloed a Lost sector 1340 at 1326 power level cause I wanted that exotic, and got it. Most casual gamers wont bother which is stupid, because you want players striving to get better, not lock them out because theyll get one shot by a rank and file enemy. So yeah, its only through vast experiences that I can offer these suggestions to make the game better. Will it ever change? No, the game is not new.Another edit...... Trials of Osiris - Season of the lost - seems to have definitely changed for the better, average PVP players like myself have been able to go Flawless (Isnt easy, but definitely worth putting in the work and practice) for the last 2 weekends starting Mid-September 2021.

I am a long-time Destiny player and I have played this game since launch and played Destiny one since launch. Yet every time I boot up this game, I am still surprised about how much of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 fest it is. To start the servers on Destiny 2 are possible the worst I have ever played on, every game of crucible feels like I am having a stroke, players will sometimes just disappear and reappear in front of your eyes. The destiny 2 servers also cause crazy numbers of trades, sometimes the other player will already be dead, yet you still get killed by them. The balancing team on this game is also brain dead, as half the classes/weapons in this game are unusable because of the meta. Which bungie allows to run rampant for substantial periods of time. To compensate for the braindead balancing team, bungie will make all your previous gear \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and make it to where you must regrind the activity you already played a thousand times. The only fun part of this game (pvp) is basically never touched, the last time they added \u201cnew maps\u201d was on October 1, 2019. I put new maps in parentheses because normally it is not even a new map they add, because it ends up being just another asset brought over from Destiny one, which should have been in the game from launch. This point also carries over to basically every part of the game, as a lager majority of the armor and weapons are either reskins or just brought back due to fact, they had already taken it out of Destiny 1/Destiny 2. Bungie also further ruined their game by adding light advantage to pvp. I have enough time to dedicate to this game to get my light to max, but if you do not, you might as well not even play.  This is due to the fact, all the end game activities that provide you with the stuff you want require you to be Max power. I would not put this as a problem if grinding for power was fun, but not surprisingly it\u2019s not. Grinding for power in this game is the most brain numbing experience, as it makes you play the same activities repeatedly, week in and week out. But it gets better, the best part about everything I have said so far is you can\u2019t even play the new \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 content without spending another 10-60$ for the new expansion. And even if you buy the expansion, you do not even get all the cool armor because they lock majority of the cool cosmetics behind a pay wall.

It takes you to the most recent stories. Which might seem bad, but as someone who only got into it roughly a week ago, it works. Even though youre playing a totally different story then when it began, the story is told to you through encounters, other players, and flashbacks. 18 hours worth of game after getting it and \"Beyond light\" (2-3 days later IRL), I found myself at light level 1260, and begging for more. Its the multiplayer game you wish you could have control of. You can join with randoms, or friends, or both if you like! If you wish to play alone, you can! if you need a little help, you can ask for it! Does the game have flaws? Sure, but what game doesnt? its fun. It can be serious, silly, quirky, or even challenging if you so like! Heck, it can be a combination of any of those. Pick a path! if you get stuck, turn back and pick another path!

Here are a few that bother me.PvP is PAY TO WIN. Stasis is here to stay, and only getting stronger.Bungie does not care for your time, they purposefully make things take a very long time. This is a grindy game.Bungie will not reimburse your time for their mistakes or bugs.Bungie dont spend adequate time polishing their content before releasing, its a little rushed. With that being said they are also quicker about solving time saving glitches than they are about patching time wasting bugs or fixing balancing issues. PvP is pay to win, its about as simple as that. If you have stasis youre chances of winning have gone up considerably! Most stasis ults are too strong. There is like literally zero counter play to them, even with other ults. They are oppressive and un-fun in PvP.  The warlock can freeze you around walls and then insta kill you with a massive AOE finisher and the titan is like extendo-aoe thundercrash on freezing steroids. At least Titans got an exotic that made stasis less effective after 6 months of torture, but other light-based classes continue to suffer, especially hunters that cant fly in the air for ten seconds or shoot iron man beams through literal walls.The only semi-bad (I use this lightly because of the strong zone control) stasis ult is the hunters, you can reliably kill them when they ult because they are forced to completely stop moving to throw it. So naturally, Bungie decided to nerf it considerably.They didnt fix the weird tracking/bugging into walls part though where you essentially dont even get the linger/squal part. Ok Bungie now what about all the other stasis stuff? New aspects to make them even stronger? Oh ok. Stasis is really fun in PvE at least. Speaking of new patches and bugs! The new season had so many bugs, and still has a decent amount! The buglist for this game is pretty long, and many of the mechanics dont work as intended. This is made even worse by the fact that trying to replicate or test bugs is made exceptionally difficult by Bungie, more on that later. Aside from the bugs and the whole pay to win player versus player thing, the real major gripe Ive got with Bungie/Destiny2 is their games clarity. The game is so beyond mind numbingly confusing. Everything about the game from the mechanics of guns and armor and how they interact with each other along with all perks both of them have, to the wording of whats going on or where to go, the sense of direction and whats going on, is all SO confusing.  The amount of data you need to find out yourself is overwhelming to say the least. Even basic things like gun stats are vague and half of them are hidden, no new player would ever find out  about it without community help and resource sharing. Then theres exotic armor/gun and armor mod combinations that almost have zero interaction information or what takes priority. The only problem is it matters, a lot. Trust me there are so many super obscure tiny details and yet they matter so much on this game. Dont get me wrong, theres nothing wrong with a sense of discovery in a game, but Bungie is being vague on things that should be being explained thoroughly. To this point they even REMOVED the only training grounds type place in the entire game so that you cannot even test damage numbers, experiment, or test bugs etc. Super lame. Credit where credit is due though.  The sandbox aesthetics and music are always on point, and overall game play is pretty fun. The best part about the game is the community though, and without all the people that work so hard to make sense of this mess bungie has created, the game would be dead. The systems are slowly improving and getting better, but I just wish Bungie would really buckle down and do a massive QoL fix so that new and old players alike could actually play the game they want to play instead of the guess mess that it is right now.TL:DR Until the in-game information, game systems, and glitches/bugs are in a better state; I cannot recommend this game to new players unless: 1. They are willing to sink hundreds of hours figuring out the secrets of how Destiny 2 plays and then let Bungie control their fate. 2.

The result has sadly been the complete opposite.The Forsaken expansion is 3 years old at this point and it still costs the same amount as a standard launch title, not to mention that theyve actually made the game MORE expensive than AB did, with season pass purchases on top of their overpriced yearly expansions and in-game micro-transaction store. If that wasnt bad enough, theyve removed pretty much all of the original campaign content, which I had paid for with the base game. I essentially have no story content available to me anymore, besides a couple of intro/teaser missions for the paid expansions. At this point, while the game appears as \"free to play\" on Steam, there is no content worth playing to justify that definition. You can run around in the open world and shoot some stuff. Thats about it.I know that there will always be elitists with bags of money to spend on Destiny, but I dont understand how Bungie can expect to attract new players or retain the existing, more budget oriented ones who just want to play a game with their friends without constantly being separated from them by paywalls.Bungie have always been the masters of first-person gunplay, and this game is no exception, but as far as I can see, Destiny 2 is just going to continue losing players unless they can start giving regular gamers something to keep coming back for. If it were up to me, I would suggest only charging $60 for the current-year content, OR sell a season pass, OR have an in-game store (just one of those, certainly not all three), and just make all content from previous years part of the free-to-play experience.

If you are not a fan of this game, but for some reason acquired Destiny 2, then just sit and go with a calm soul, but remember everything that you did not go through to this part, you must definitely go through. Since the plots of all parts are intertwined with different threads. I will not spoil, and tell stories, if there is no money to purchase or if you feel sorry for the video material to help you. If we compare in terms of progress, then Destiny 2, just globally significantly stepped into the perth, cut scenes and dialogues in the prologue are more and more interesting than in the entire first part.Features of the game - against the background of complaints that in the first part, the bosses were monotonous and easy to complete, in the second part they add bosses with 2-3 stages and changing arenas. Most likely, the developers took the players complaints as personal insults. A large number of monsters have been added to the game, with which now it will definitely not be boring. But for all the abundance of added hardcore, we are adding class abilities for more epic and exciting battles. So it is with the PvP mode for 4 people, where all your abilities increase, but this opinion may be divided. The most important thing that I forgot to say is the atmosphere, large outer spaces and various worlds. Elements of strategies where you can plan a battle, a game in which you can sit out a huge amount, Dozens of hours.The graphics in the game are many times better, richer and more colorful. They did not save on all this stuff and with optimization, everything was done on a level and flew on a PC, with super speed. New renderings of models, locations, special effects, etc.Conclusion - no matter how sad it is, it must be accepted as it is.

Also some of the seasonal weapons got that non-shader-able crap on them, can we stop doing that yeah?Expunge genuinely sucks. Add three perks to every weapon that drops from this game mode and I still wont want to play it. I got sick of this type of game mode after finishing the Whisper catalyst a few years back, Harbinger and Presage already completely killed my desire to deal with this crap, and this ones even worse since you dont get an exotic out of it. Tired of activity where you smack your head against some platforming until you learn the route and then proceed to mindlessly go through it slowly losing the will to play until you Bungies wacky geometry eats your jump or you get physics killed and go to orbit after being reminded that Bungie loves making things genuinely unenjoyable.VoG doesnt have enough loot worth grinding it for, basically just doing it for spoils, no ornaments and three of the weapons from the OG version are straight up gone. Perks that made the guns worthwhile in D1 arent even available in D2, can thank the PvP sandbox for that one, Bungie could fix it by making a perk like Final Round only work on PvE enemies, but thatd be actual work so no to that one. Took about a dozen loot clears to get Mythoclast, it might actually be the worst raid exotic Destiny 2 has ever seen. Also raid mods being tied to elements and having a cost makes them not worth running, Bungie youre insane if you still think Im gonna keep three sets of armor per raid, or that Ill spend mod capacity on... Some extra damage against oracles? Shouldve just been an inherent trait on the armor. Also rewards that should have been in the raid being in the Eververse, genuinely uncool move by Bungie.New nightfall guns are pretty lackluster, fusion rifle has about two decent perks and pray you dont get a charge time masterwork because that still hasnt been changed, Hung Jurys back but its a 180 so it never stood a chance to begin with. Oh yeah theres that new sniper, I guess its got some okay potential but are we really expected to farm GMs for an okay weapon now?Ritual weapon this season is disappointing, genuinely works better using the more boring perk of high impact reserves. Least it looks nice so theres that.The new season pass exotic is crap, as it should be, but also shoulda never been added to begin with and is a waste of any and all effort that went into putting it into the game. Season pass ornament for it looks like crap too, at least its not gold for once so theres that. The season pass ornaments for armor all look pretty ugly too, aint as bad as last season but still genuine eye sores, specially the Titan gauntlets.Seasonal challenges genuinely suck, and mostly because theyre not retroactive. Make all of them retroactive or release them all at the start of the season, zero purpose for them to be released week by week except to piss people off by making them go  back and rank up in Gambit again to drive up those numbers and make it seem like people actually like that game mode.Oh yeah transmog, thats some crap. Already hit the cap on my Titan a week ago, woulda hit the cap on all of them if I could manage to care but this game leaves a sour taste in my mouth every time I launch it now.Also there was that point in time where new guns werent even dropping in Iron Banner so it was a genuine waste of time to play. Sleeper Simulant didnt even get its buff, so there was that too.Bungie nerfed Stasis, thats about the one highlight of the season. Still solid subclasses, just not as keyboard-smashingly oppressive as before. Thats what counts as a highlight now, getting a fix for something that killed any desire to play entire gamemodes after about half a year.", "Author": "Geese", "Hours": 2583.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: February 24, 2021", "Review": "This game saved my life.I am 42.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didnt beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We dont fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldnt be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

One of my favourite parts of the visuals are the backgrounds, Im just going to say, they are too beautiful. Gameplay: 10/10Im going to make this part short and just say that this game is smooth as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, everything from the movement to the aiming is buttery smooth. (the only part this isnt smooth is my framerate in a few locations)Audio: 10/10This game has the best music Ive ever heard in any video game. No matter where you are you will be blessed by the music that always fits perfectly with your surroundings.Bugs: Rarely annoyingThere are a decent amount of bugs and out of bounds zones, but you need to be looking for them to find them. The only annoying bugs are ones that send you to out of bounds zones and softlock you, but theyre rare to come across.Enjoyment: 9/10This is the game I enjoy most out of all game I have by far, the only reason why Im not giving it a 10/10 is because your game crashes more often then it should and you sometimes get bullied by error codes that send you to the menu screen.Hours required to complete: At least 1000Im 1,000 hours in and I feel like Im nowhere near the finish line. You cant really beat this game, you can always do something to level up your gear and get stronger, thats the main reason why a ridiculous amount of people have more than 1,000 hours.PC requirements: Not too demandingI had a friend with a somewhat bad laptop and he could run about 30 FPS with worst settings.Long story short: if you want to play a somehow fun grinding game whilst your ears and eyes are going through heaven, play this game.

I donated 100 hours to the game before the grind really set in, and that probably had more to do with the Shadowkeep season missions being deadly tedious. If youve never played it before, its free, and an exceptionally beautiful and playable shooter, with production values that demolish every other game in the genre. But it does suffer from the genres worst traits - repetitive missions and activities, level grinding, and a rather dreadful loot system. The core gameplay loop is enough fun that this doesnt matter for a long time, but eventually the rate of accumulation of better equipment sharply stagnates, your gear score goes up by one pathetic point every 5 hours, every progression mission youre saddled with is a tedious grind, and you realise that most of the encounters are just shooting galleries that play out the same way again, and again, and again. Sadly, we recently hit a point in which the developers removed at least half of the planets you could visit...ostensibly for story reasons. But in effect they redacted half the content to force people to buy the new Beyond Light DLC, which is far inferior to the content they removed. So Im not entirely sure you can play all the old legacy missions as I could when I started. Its enraged the player base for good reason, and the best reviews on Steam accurately reflect the games potential for both joy and disappointment. But in any case, absolutely play the game if youve never played it before. Its fantastic for the largest part.

Every new activity that gets released is just a recycle of something that was previously used and after 3 years of bungie doing this, i have lost complete interest in playing the game. I dont recommend this game to anybody anymore until things change. Boring game, not fun 3/10Post Bungie 30th Aniversery:This game has had a complete turn around. There are so many activities and rewards and actual fun has been brought into the game. I have gained so much respect for bungie as they just keep continuing to impress me with all of these destiny 2 updates, the new dungeon is amazing, the new activity is fun, and xur is an absolute legend. Also, lets not forget about the infamous JUAN. JUAN IS LOVE JUAN IS LIFE. The visuals continue to get better in destiny, the narrative continues to get better, the lore continues to grow. I think that come February 22 2022, when witch queen releases, I believe that Destiny 2 will be one of the greatest games on steam, if not the greatest game. Of you havent checked out destiny in its current form, I believe you should try it out, It is better than it ever has been.The only downside that I have from bungie, is that every single thing they decide to add is a paid expansion. It would be nice if I didnt have to spend so much money every year. But the content they produce is so worth it and I will continue to dump every penny I have into getting more Destiny content.

I really did.I suppose the first big problem is that the f2p/starting game puts you immediately at a strong level (not bad in and of itself) and just flat out REMOVED the content of the base game. I was really looking forward to progressing through the story and leveling up and they simply made that impossible. Also, despite removing all context of the base game, everybody still talks about the events of it, so it feels VERY disjointed story-wise.Unless you purchase expansions (which I did), you get 2 earth zones, three other planet zones, and an \"current expansion\" planet. Two of these areas are remakes of destiny 1 areas. There really isnt much there. You get the first step to each campaign before it takes you to the store and encourages you to purchase the storyline and activities for those areas. Outside of the story for each expansion, I didnt find a lot of variety.For a company that made Halo, it was amazing how bad the pvp was. Every single match ended VERY lopsided before the game cuts it short. Deaths came pretty much instantly and without warning, most usually from a single hand cannon headshot. Its difficult to know what to improve when you dont even know how/why/who you died to, or did wrong. The game awards bonus super energy to better players, and abilities do not refresh between deaths. It feels as if the game is actively punishing weaker players instead of helping them out for a better experience (and a more challenging one to the better players).tl;dr I suggest looking elsewhere for your FPS needs.

You get literally no explanation to whats going on in the game. Little to no tutorial to actually understand how to play the game. Nothing is given to you unless you watch 50+ hours of YouTube tutorials. Waste of time. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you Bungie, Bungie sucks, dont buy anything from Bungie, they no longer deserve any financial support. Oh, not to mention the fact that every single event has a price tag of some sort. \"Free to play,\" is a lie. \"Pay to play\" is much more accurate. Not sure why Bungie doesnt slap a price tag on the initial game and only allow the purchase of the most recent expansion. Oh, I know why! Because theyre greedy! Thats why! Yep. They care more about money than they do the quality of gameplay.\"Oh, but spending 30 hours worth of gameplay grinding a single drop that\u2014even though it might drop\u2014wont even be the roll Ive been grinding for, forcing me to grind another 30 hours is what the game is about!\" Yeah, if you have a severe mental disorder.Moral of the review: The lore of the game is good, the gameplay is... OK, the grind is disgusting. The category \"looter-shooter\" doesnt justify it, especially when you cant get the stuff you want to shoot to loot unless you pay to unlock it.\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, Bungie. A waste of 700 hours. The fun I had with friends doesnt even make it worth it.More stuff edited in:The only good thing about buying the expansions are the story. That really is it. Sure the PvP can rarely, and I mean EXTREMELY rarely be fun, and there usually arent cheaters. Oh, but when there are, there are a LOT of them, and they are VERY blatant. Iron Banner is honestly the only thing worth grinding in the game anymore aside from your light level and weekly CHORES, not missions, CHORES.Raids are OK, but for one reason or another, you will ALWAYS have a group where one, maybe two peoples brains turn off. Seriously, dont do a raid after you get all of the transmog gear and Exotic. Save yourself the pain, the raids suck lol. TL;DRDestiny 2 is nothing more than what feels like a Pay-To-Play gacha game than it does a looter shooter. Its not worth paying for unless you plan to play a lot with friends.

PvP is enjoyable, kind of broken sometimes but since this is not an eSport focused game, I think that is fine. PvPvE (Gambit) is ok when playing with friends IMO. The main content is PvE, you can just spend some time for free roaming in different destinations killing adds, completing public events, lost sectors and so on, completing strikes, nightfalls or Raids. There are different quests and missions as well: 3 story driven campaigns (Forsaken, Shadowkeep, Beyond light) which are part of the paid content, the red war and the first 2 DLCs were removed from the game when  the last DLC was released. There are tons of equipment, armor sets and weapons that you can obtain from random drops, completing specific activities or after completing a quest. Im not sure how the game is with the free content alone, but thats a good start to figure it out if you like it or not and then proceed to purchase the additional DLCs and season passes. I would recommend you buy the Deluxe edition since it has all 4 seasons passes for this year along with the last DLC. (Forsaken and Shadowkeep are not included but they can be bundled for better deal).The game has its flaws (PvP sometimes broken, bugs here and there, but bungie usually addresses those issues to keep the game enjoyable). Some people complain about the \"lack\" of content. But If you are reading this, then you are probably new and havent played the game yet, in that case Id say that the game has a lot to offer, start with the free version and if you like the core game, then youll enjoy the rest.

Unfortunately, it has recently been met with the harsh reality of a deadline imposed on doing so due to their impending removal and the futility of starting something that I would have to haphazardly rush my way through to avoid the risk of not being able to finish. Now that content is gone, lost to mismanaged patchwork and poor attempts to reshape the games singleplayer experience using lopsided metrics. This is no longer a game for anyone seeking solo or PVE gameplay, and the inability to revisit even purchased content of that nature has yielded a very real chilling effect on the prospect of buying anything Bungie releases going forward. Whether this game will ever be worth playing again, for me, relies entirely on Bungie walking back their decision to cut such a large amount of content from the game.

It feels like they only cater to those who have been with this entry and the series in the long-term. I started about a week or two before the most recent update (which is Beyond Light). I liked how New Light (the update right before Beyond Light and when the game went F2P) was generally accepting of new players but I was not a fan of starting at such a high power level (even if it is necessary because of the large amount of players at the cap). Let me work my way up. The progression felt very forced and unnatural as a result of raising the baseline power level from near-zero to 750. It also was difficult as someone new to play the MAIN campaign and its two free expansions; its almost like Bungie just wants you to play online PVP and gamemodes where cosmetics and other recurring income for them is the focus. This gets me to my final point - Bungie has removed all three pieces of original content (everything up to before there were paid expansions) as well as entire planets/moons. About 1/3-to-half the game is removed now and the only things of importance (imo) remaining are the two paid expansions and the newest update (Beyond Light). I didnt get to finish the original stories and I am saddened because I enjoyed it for what it was and even paid for in-game content because I felt like I was getting too much content to only play for free.tl;dr: It feels like they are continuing to alienate new players and one of the biggest culprits is removing major story content that the game came out with when it first launched.", "Author": "adamadam63", "Hours": 24.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 14, 2020", "Review": "the number for the suicide prevention hotline is 800-273-8255youre gonna need it", "Author": "smongbobby", "Hours": 335.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 14, 2020", "Review": "its pretty cool", "Author": "SoleFool18", "Hours": 483.1}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 14, 2020", "Review": "[TL;DR: The gameplay is patently tedious and the story lines are confusing and short. The devs have removed the vanilla content in favor of some new expansion rather than just making a new game like some kind of sensible studio. New players can no longer get involved with the way this game has been run.]Ive been a part of this franchise ever since all the way back to Destiny 1 and the kindest way that I can describe Destiny 2 is that it is a bog standard MMO disguised as a First Person Shooter. More appropriately; it is an empty perpetual grind machine disguised as an adventure/RPG.This game has had a series of blunders ever since its launch in September of 2017 when it had repeated several mistakes that were present at the launch of Destiny 1; the most prominent of those being an overall lack of content. Since then, Bungie have done many deceitful things such as: secretly throttling XP gain to incentivize micro-payments; changing cosmetics to consumables to incentivize buying more with mirco-payments; designing an entire holiday event to block all event-exclusive content behind micro-payments; (are you starting to see a pattern here?) overtime, locking more and more cosmetics and social emotes behind micro-payments; having a history of ignoring their players pleas and feedback in the hopes that theyll just calm down and go to the micro-payment store; etc. etc. etc.Even if you ignore all of the greed, you still cant ignore the wild mismanagement of the game. To start, Bungie rebooted Destiny 2 mid-development because of in-office fighting essentially cutting their development time in half and limiting the scope of the game. Since then, the game has been in a constant state of mediocrity with little to do besides the 40 different flavors of run around and shoot things that move. Bungie, being more focused on monetization than innovation, have seen their playerbase dwindle into record low numbers. It is also worth noting that Bungie did separate from Activision not too long ago and took the Destiny IP with them. When they did, they went along with the playerbases celebratory joy and claimed that this was a new beginning for them and they would do so much to improve the Destiny experience. They didnt. They kept the micro-payment store which was the thing people wanted gone the most; they keep hacking out tedious expansions with campaigns that last 2-3 hours max; they refuse to try new things with gameplay and just stick to the same shoot and loot garbage; etc.Bungie just cant seem to climb out of this hole that theyve dug for themselves no matter how many more expansions they grind out. What is especially unhelpful is the increasing unfriendliness toward new players. Destiny 2s story lines seem as if theyre being made up as they go and the result is a confusing mess of seemingly unrelated events mixed with lots and lots of shooting to tie the cutscenes together. In short, to know what the hell is going on in this world that youve been plunged into, you first have to buy and play all of Destiny 1; buy and play all of its DLCs; read all of its lore cards; play Destiny 2; Buy and play all of its DLCs; read all of its lore and then you might have a general idea of whats going on. If you dont do those things, then youll just be part of a bunch of conversations where characters talk to you about significant past events - for which, you were not present - that somehow caused the current crisis and will be a relevant piece to the overall story.Lastly, people should know that Destiny 2, the game, is gone. If you load up Destiny 2 right now, you will have no campaign to play. Aside from a few short starter missions and paywalls being thrown in your face left and right, you will not have access to Destiny 2s campaign because the devs have quite literally removed it from the game. Basically, it all amounts to Bungie making a huge new expansion that - instead of making a new game for it like some kind of developer with experience and common sense - they crammed it into the already massive download size of Destiny 2. They saw this and decided that the best course of action would be to remove the entire first campaign and the two proceeding expansions along with most of the planets in which they took place in order to make room for the new stuff. There is literally no way to play Destiny 2s original content anymore. The game being free is now a trap to lure you into buying the expansions.This process called \"content vaulting\", frankly, should have caused a bigger uproar within the playerbase because this is not okay by any stretch of the imagination. Those of us who actually spent money on Destiny 2 and its expansions when they werent free have just had the things we paid for taken away from us by the seller so that we can go and buy the new shiny thing they have. That is a terrible example to set for other development studios and publishers. A buyer should not have to consider the factor of their purchase possibly being revoked within a year or so simply because its in the way of the new thing.If I still havent convinced you to avoid this game and you plan to give it a go, at least get a friend to play with you so you can both suffer with each other. I didnt even get a chance to talk about the nonexistent matchmaking in raids, the bipolar server connections or the large life commitment that this game requires of you.In summary, I cant recommend this game to anyone who isnt already widely familiar with the Destiny universe.

It encaptures a completely different aspect of the gaming world and there is really no game like it. No matter what you compare it to, it is in itself a completely different game than anything out there and that is one of the things that makes this game so special.The solo-player experience is extremely welcoming and allows the player thousands of hours of entertainment and the chance to progress to the maximum level without needing help from other players. From soloing endgame content such as grand-master nightfalls and grabbing solo chests in raids, Destiny allows for solo oriented players to progress at their own rate and have a chance to compete with players in communities.The multiplayer activites such as crucible, raids, and open world activites are so enthralling and provide an infinite amount of entertainment. There is no way to experience everything there is in this game. Even if you hit max level, there is so much min/maxing you can do as well as collecting amazing weapon and armor roles to prepare for future content.An example of something I have never seen before happened just hours ago, and it was amazing. I was running a Flawless Crown of Sorrow (Raid from Forsaken: Season of Opulence) and when we killed the final boss I made sure to warn the group not to get killed by the crown dropping and crushing you. Everyone laughed it off saying they would not die to it and avoided the falling crown. As we celebrated our victory, and me celebrating first trying my second flawless Crown, I turned towards where our loot would appear. One man stood on the exact spot that the chest yielding our rewards would spawn, but there was not enough time to warn him. His limp body flew across the room in a flash as the chest spawned in and we were concurrently sent to orbit immediately, unable to collect our rewards for completing the Crown of Ease. We all laughed as that was the most unique way to die in a flawless raid, a flawless raid that had just been completed, was considered a fail. Those that had yet to complete it still got their triumphs for flawless, but the clear did not count on Raid Report. It was hilarious and something I have never seen.This is  THE BEST  game released to date, hands down.

The developers of this game can go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 themselves. And they dont know what the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 they are doing especially for PvP absolute \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The map designers are also autistic. shotguns in multiplayer are the biggest virgin \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 thing Ive ever known. If you dont know how to make any sort of actual balance changes for things that need to be changed than just dont bother making a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 PvP. The raids are glitchy as all hell, the PvP is beyond terrible, and all the characters but like 2 suck ass and I couldnt give two \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about. servers are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 too. Whoever was the brain dead dumbass that had the idea of gambit needs to get fired and have his family ran over by a bus. Everyone who plays this game is just autistic, virgin dumbasses. This games been out for years now and they still cant figure out how a proper jump mechanic works. Honestly just go back to Halo its the only thing Bungie ever did right. I dont understand how a company can go from making a good game like Halo to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 themselves with Destiny. I cant express how bad this game is. And then they decide its a good idea to vault like half of the game. I just dont understand what the developers for this game are thinking when they do literaly anything to the game. Nothing they ever do helps the game in any way. Game breaking bugs \"ya keep those\" but content the game needs \"no we can get rid of that no ones going to want to do that\". Absolute idiots. That Beyond Light tower event sucked to. Who had the bright idea to add ice powers to pvp? They should be fired. Why are you guys putting out overpriced \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 dlcs when there are still tons of game breaking bugs still in your game. Stasis is the most retarded thing ive ever seen and straight up just annoying. Yall are just beyond \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 stupid. Never make another game again just dont. Payed 40$ for a DLC which took away more game than it put back. Just started playing again after leaving for like 3 months and yall still havent fixed the most basic of game design issues. How can yall call yourself a triple A company you dont even have stable servers. You guys really dont know how the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to do anything right do you. Its crazy to me how bad your game is. Who ever thought that stasis was a good idea to add in pvp should be fired. Even your PvE is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 garbage. Never make another \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game again. Fix your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game. You are all brain dead autistic pricks. I dont know why I think that anything changes with this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game, but I keep coming back to play it and the same \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is there. Also if you hide like a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in gambit when someone invades you instead of fighting you are the biggest \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ass \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on the planet. The crucible is so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 dumb all it is is getting stuck in stupid ass slow fields and watching yourself get killed by the same two dumb ass guns. I think that my overall issue with this game is that there are so many really cool exotic combos you can do and fun play styles to switch things up with, but if you use any of them that isnt the stupidly broken one that is meta at that current time you can never have fun playing the game. I really do like this game, but for its own sake Witch Queen better be insanely good in order to make up for having spent 60$ on beyond light. I first started this review at around 40 hours of play time and am now at 400 hours and everything I have said in this review is still true, however at the very least I have seen some good balance changes. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this game and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 every single person that has ever said \"its not a pvp game its focus is on pve game play\" overload is stupid \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The one thing that I will give to Destiny is that they have the balls to stick by their decisions even if a lot of people dont like those decisions. ITS BEEN FOUR YEARS HOW THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 CAN IT STILL BE SO \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 BAD. Nobody plays games like bigger virgins than the people in Iron Banner.

Destiny 2 has been, and continues to be a fantastic experience for me, but may not be for everyone![/hr]Pros \u2013 What the game does well\u2026Fantastic gunplay: Guns feel great to shoot, and there are plenty of different gun archetypes to experiment with in the sandbox. Learning each weapon perk, and experimenting with a combination of weapon perks, abilities, and exotic armor perks offers many hours of fun exploration.Fashion: Each of the three classes have an astounding number of beautiful armor sets to mix and match, and while the coloration of those armors are customizable only through color packs called shaders rather than a color picker, shaders are so numerous that often times this is not an issue.Friendgame: Most of the activities in Destiny 2 are enjoyable both solo and with a group. All of the early game content (Story Missions, Strikes, low-level Nightfalls) can be done with 1-3 people. Diverse game modes: Destiny 2 genuinely offers a variety of different activity types that appeal to different kinds of players. Strikes, Dungeons, Raids, and Adventures are all different types of PVE content that are unique regarding objective, time required to complete, cooperation required, ect. PVP content includes a variety of modes ranging from casual, to competitive, to hyper competitive. There is even a game mode that combines the two: Gambit, though to mixed reception. [/hr]Cons \u2013 What the game does poorly\u2026Limited gun sandbox: After becoming familiar with the 16 weapons types (and the 0-3 weapon frame variations of each), you will find that each pulse rifle with the same frame will feel more or less the same. This means that while Destiny 2 offers thousands of different guns, many of them will simply feel like platforms for different perk pools rather than wholly different weapons. Cheaters: While Bungie has been very clear that they are aware of the issues and have made changes to try and squash the problem, PVP activities still have quite a few cheaters. This, bundled with the fact that the most common cheats / hacks used in D2 are subtle, means that as you climb higher in the ranked ladder, you will always have to wonder if the opponent you are facing is just that much better, or has the benefit of aimbots and wallhacks. Very simplistic character advancement: While this looks like it is changing for the better, Destiny 2 still only offers a very limited way to advance your characters stats, abilities, and power. Your guardian selects a class at creation, and then can swap freely between 3 subclass option, each with 3 branches of abilities. However, rather than mixing and matching these branches, you select entire branches to pull from. Meaning each class only has 9 possible variations for their abilities. After that, all further customization comes from your guardian\u2019s armor stats and exotic armor perks.  [/hr]Things of Note \u2013 What you should know going in\u2026 Limited content: The game offers a lot to do, but is not the kind of game you can play for 20 hours a week, every week, and stay happy. Is a perfect fit if you spend a lot of time working, play other games, or have other hobbies.Friend Requirement: Some of the best content for Destiny 2 requires premade teams and genuine cooperation. This means that adamant solo players will be leaving high level Nightfalls, Trials of Osiris, and Raids on the table. While for many this will be a boon, players looking for a singleplayer experience will run out of content significantly sooner.

I could buy a good game with that money.  plus the new content is not enough and gets boring after literally a few days.  and all the brain-dead fans that defend Bungie and hand over their money to them are a part of the problem. I loved this game but things have gotten way out of hand.  at this point, I think theyre removing more content than theyre adding to the game which is a damn shame.  and they removed so much content that the main story of the game is barely cohesive from all the campaigns that have been removed.  hopefully Bungie turns things around with Witch Queen but with all the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that theyve pulled JUST THIS YEAR, I have little hope for it.  honestly to fix all the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ups theyve had with the story in terms of bad storytelling and removing content is to just make a third game.  Also if Bungie Is selling an expansion for $40.00 and only includes a few hour-long campaigns, 1 strike, 1 raid with some replay value, and barely any new weapons WHILE also taking out a sizeable amount of the game (Yes I am talking about beyond light) that is borderline a scam. and they are also taking PAID CONTENT out of the game that I paid FOR and making me buy a whole new 40 DOLLAR EXPANSION for arguably LESS then that is just plain scummy.

I truly believe that this game is one of the most beautiful pieces of art. The aesthetic design is absolute genius, the art director(s) were able to craft an amazing contrast of futuristic and post-apocalyptic with an side tone of medieval designs. At one hand you have the blocky, sharp toned, robotic aesthetic and on the other you have the grayed, rusted broken down ruins of an apocalypse. In-between the two is the European crests and medieval suits of armor, hammers, knives, swords and magic. This game is really a work of art. Not to mention the particle system is the best of any game, it is very optimised and amazing to look at.On the other hand: the gameplay is often very grindy, filled with glitches and has many flaws to its movement and combat system. Enemies, CPU or players, often teleport around from lag. The reloading is slow and unforgiving. For example: you already move pretty slow most the time, even while sprinting, and you tend to have to reload a lot, while in combat it is very important to keep moving to avoid dying but you practically have to stand still to reload and if you happen to tap sprint just a millisecond before the reload is finished, it cancels and youd be better of just dying to reload your gun.The Movement:  It sucks. Once again, running and walking feel unnecessarily slow and thats not even including the fact that you cant strafe while running. Youll find yourself just holding down W while moving. The jetboost is also annoying; it makes you feel like you are drifting out into space with almost no control to stop yourself or change directions.

The free to play aspect only applies to the base portion of the game and to even do anything at this point you need to get about 3 DLCs and a Season pass (As of writing this post the breakdown is as follows: Newest DLC 39.99, previous 2 DLC bundle 49.99, Season pass 14.99. 104.97 total for a free to play game.) And to top it off, most of the content will be removed when the newest DLC drops even if you don\u2019t purchase it.A little backstory since my total playtime isn\u2019t represented accurately in steam. I played D1 for about 4000 hours on XB1 under the same username as D2 and played D2 up to the start of the Forsaken totaling about 1400 hours.  I have played almost every aspect that this game had to offer up until that point.Starting with the good, though there isn\u2019t much at this point.Graphics are great. They sometimes tell the story of where you are and what you are doing better than the narration. I love the skyboxes and just the general atmosphere of the game. Very visually appealing.Gameplay feels like incredibly smooth once you have a grasp how to utilize the games double jump mechanic, and that doesn\u2019t take long. You can do some crazy movements and feel like you own whatever battle you are in.Even though I don\u2019t feel like the Destiny 2 raids really stand up to the ones in original Destiny, I feel it is worth mentioning. Raiding is one of the main draws of this game to me and even though the new ones didn\u2019t stick with me, it was an overall fun experience.There is nothing else positive about this game so here is the bad.The story is all over the place. It\u2019s hard to follow unless you play everything as it comes out and even then it can be very difficult to understand what is going on or what you are even doing sometimes.Bungie abuses FOMO mechanics to make you feel like you\u2019re always missing something important when 90% of the rewards are unrewarding and then proceeds to make all the stuff meaningless by making gear have a planned obsolescence date.Introducing DCV and \u2018vaulting\u2019 content that we paid for in a free to play game that is only a few years old if that because the \u2018game is too big\u2019. It isn\u2019t, its 91GB and is currently in a content drought that\u2019s been around since D2s release. Here are a few things that will be removed from the game upon the new DLC release; (https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49189)-Mars, Io, Titan, Mercury, and the Leviathan will no longer be available.-All PvE content related to those locations are no longer accessible.- 7 Strikes are being removed- Leviathan and Scourge of the Past raids are being removed-10 Crucible (PvP) maps are being removedPvP is unbalance and almost always one sided as the matchmaking system is and always has been broken. If you are a new to this game, don\u2019t even bother trying to get into it. Most of if not all of the weapons that are worth using in PvP are usually quest based or some form of long grind (that includes multiple PvP objectives) or in most cases like our favorite shotgun, Felwinter\u2019s Lie, it\u2019s locked behind a limited time event. Even if you play during that event, it only has a chance to be there when the event shows up.To add to PvP, there is no cheat prevention. When I played back during the first 2 years of D2 it wasn\u2019t as big of an issue as it is now but it is a huge active problem if you want to PvP for anything more than doing bounties.Finally and literally the worst thing they have ever done is add Eververse to the game. Or after they lost their shame they just call it the store in the main menu now. If the lack of content was a negative, this doubles down on that. It was bad when they added it back in D1 but it got worse in D2. When they added this cancer to the game they told us this: (https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/13672)\u201cOur plan is to use these new items to bolster the service provided by our live team for another full year, as they grow and create more robust and engaging events that we\u2019ll announce later this year.\u201dAnyone remember Sparrow Racing League? Because that seemed to be the one and only time we got something that was tied to Eververse and wasn\u2019t a complete micro transaction event. Eververse has just become a place to put items that should be drops throughout the game or rewards tied to completing Achievements or Triumphs. Oh, and those events they mentioned in the above news article? I remember the first Dawning event that happened after D2 was released. I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers but If I recall correctly it was like 70% of the items were behind the Eververse paywall, and the other 30% was time gated. If you were lucky with drops and played it like a full time job you may have gotten something you wanted. This has been the theme for all their events. (Crimson Days, Festival of the Lost, The Dawning, and a few others)There is no hope for Bungie, they have come a long way since the company that made Halo and it seems they have lost their touch and their way of making meaningful content for gamers. I will never touch this game or anything with the Bungie logo on it ever again.Edit: Game is still absolute trash. Hundreds of hours of content removed and still the same problems from before this game was even on PC let alone steam. Dont give bungie any more money, let the company die already so we can have a company with enough brain power to execute a looter shooter game.Edit: Steam asking me if my opinion has changed since i have more time played.

FIRST OF ALLI am by no means a professional reviewer I hated, at first, that a sequel was being made for this half-baked psuedo-MMO game I should have loved but could no longer tolerate. Just like in D1, when I could finally play it, I was being locked out of a large portion of content because I wasnt buying more DLC at Actibungies every whim. I even thought \"Anthem looks like exactly the kind of competition Bungie needs. Maybe itll steal all of their put-off players, frustrated by the over-priced, pathetically short Vanilla game, 2 DLCs and majorly polarizing Forsaken Expac (with Activisions seemingly Jealous Girlfriend routine when Nathan Fillion dared to ever be busy when they wanted some new voice acting for an expac), and Bungie will finally pull their head out of their asses and fix these issues, or at the very least, learn from them.\" But then Anthem was actually released. Bungie didnt even have to think about breaking a sweat. F2P DESTINY With Shadowkeep/New Lights announcement, I made the mistake of thinking that it was finally going to get better. Eververse was being reworked, no more perk-hunting in a lootbox, only costumes and cosmetics. F2P model where I could convince my friends to play with me again, and even play DLC as long as I was hosting. Didnt love that they didnt ditch the seasonal pass, but it looked like it wouldnt be as bad as a constant pestering to buy a 20 to 40 dollar expac everytime a new announcement is made, so I could probably live with it. Except thats not how it worked out at all.  Most people do not want to install a game that (at the time) was about 78 Gigs to installAll sense of PROGRESSION in a pseudo-MMO was wiped away by everyone including fresh players, being set to 750 powerYou were not only no longer pushed to play the story or the tutorial, but were given the D1 tutorial copy-pasted over, then pushed into a hokey fake public event in this area where the same loot-cave grinders from D1 will sit near the power level soft cap, grinding this high-spawn event, melting the boss to the point that I dont think new players can even get to understand what a public event IS, let alone how to play it, therefore worsening the problem of every patrol zone being infested by randoms that either dont understand what heroic events are, how to trigger them, or that some people are trying to trigger a heroic for mission progress, and the fact that any passing player can nuke an event boss solo before the heroic someone else had been working to trigger before the trigger can even activate.Theyre then dropped in the tower, then are told to do the playlist activities. The story missions of base game to Warmind content (now part of the New Light base game release, not refunded, of course) and even Forsaken, (still premium) were now in the inventory of an NPC that New Light players are not directed to for that purpose. This left the few friends of mine that actually TRIED to give D2 a chance, totally lost, and Im sure my friends werent the only ones. After being away from the game for a few months after the Season of Dawn, to now, some few weeks after the start of Season of Arrivals, even I forgot what I was even doing on my main.Between Season of Undying to Dawn, and what Ive played of Arrivals, its little different than an additional Strike being added to the game. Want to buy it? Cool, heres a free set of the seasonal armor to bump you up a little closer to the soft-cap on level 1 of the pass, and 99 more levels to unlock the same way every other game with a Battlepass does, either with more money, or experience points via gameplay. Now do that same new activity some more until you get sick of replaying it too and you realize you paid $10 USD for an extra Strike and very little story content. Dont worry though, at least you get ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL GEAR on the battle pass. Yes, you can actually Pay-for-power in Destiny 2. The new Seasonal Weapons and Armor will be scaled higher until you hit the powerlevel soft-cap. Sure, you can also get that gear as a free-pass, but with a premium pass, you get an EXP bonus every certain amount of pass levels, while free players do not. In other games with a seasonal pass, games like Fornite have tons of cosmetic rewards, so of course the better looking or alternate designs would be on the premium pass. But in games like that, there are no stats to these skins. Theyre solely cosmetic. They do not make your aim better, run faster, or make you not die as fast. Gameplay is totally unaffected whether or not you buy the pass. In Destiny 2, you dont get a \"free\" cosmetic at lvl 1 for the premium passyou get an entire set of FUNCTIONAL ARMOR. Thats power level, perks, and overall loot-drop scaling when you actually get to the gameplay. The higher number you are above 750, the more damage you deal, the less you take, and the higher the number on future gear drops will be. In a game like fortnite, the gameplay is based on YOUR OWN SKILL. In D2, the main gameplay loop is based on YOUR GEAR. With this, you pay for power, AND for cosmetics. Premium Passes get (however limited) game content, and two sets of both the full armor, weapons, AND cosmetics. Free passes get one set of Armor, one set of the weapons, and a constant flashing banner reminding them that they can buy the season pass for $10. By the way, theres monthly Twitch Prime drops! A Ghost shell (Grinding perks), a ship (actually cosmetic), An Exotic Weapon (thats right, more functional gear), and a skin for said weapon. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCEThe lack of progression was enough to pull the wind out of my sails after New Light, and the New season pass got under my skin, F2P cheaters in the PvP modes made me angry, and twitch drops felt like the last straw. I gave D2 one more chance today. After Bounty grinding for about 6 hours, and only getting from half of Pass level 8 to level 10, getting the same hand armor at the same power level 4 times, and Gnawing Hunger 5 times at 1 power level more each time, and Escape Velocity twice, all in the same session. Im done. Bungie said they were going to rework the seasonal content, but honestly, I dont believe them anymore. Unless the game is MAJORLY reworked, and the abundance of paywalls are dealt with, I have no plans of ever reinstalling this 95+ GB game again. Recap: Game is littered with tedium, Free-to-play PvP cheaters and paywalls If you have 90+ Gigs of space on your PC and about $40-60 USD burning a hole in your pocket every few months, you might not ever notice the paywalls, I mean If you want a fun F2P game with an expansive community that doesnt lock you out of content every few weeks with new paywalls, try...

PVP is kinda meh due to 0.8-1.2s TTK and hitboxes as big as a truck. Im not gonna say pvp here all that bad, its fast-paced with a good feeling to it, its just a bit casual and braindead, idk. If you want tactics and sweats go look elsewhere.  Oh, and most competitive mode with most rewards you can get from PVP still forces you to grind PVE first, so yeah... Also MM sucks a lot, and it was before they removed skill-based matchmaking from most pvp modes, so what its like now i dont wanna even know. In terms of balance, its became better lately, since they FINALLY nerfed Lord of Wolves and fusions, and couple of other things, but it still far from ideal. My 2 biggest complaints is that every season you get a few new, or old buffed guns, thats better than everything else, not that much so it becomes straight OP, like previously mentioned LoW, but obviously, if you want to min/max you are bound to use them. And since balance works like this in 99.9% of other games i can tolerate it, but not my second complaint which is sniper rifles. Well, the thing is, guess what happens when in the game, where a majority of weapons have ~0.8 TTK at minimum, there is one single type of weapons, that can one-shot? Right... Well, unlike GUESS WHAT snipers require skill to be used effectively, but still, if you want to become an absolute god at this game, or simply git gud, you are bound to use snipers and nothing else. There is also shotguns, which can also one-shot, but obviously they have a very limited range, and a bit random which makes them unreliable, unlike SR. So if you, for whatever reason, dont like SR and dont wanna use them, go f yourself. Oh, forgot to mention its best weapon to counter supers, like REALLY best, few things in a game comes close to it, and usually pretty situational, while with a sniper you just need a single headshot.PVE - is a grindfest. Thats it, lol. Except story bits, which is a main story, and some seasonal content(more on this later) it is pure grind, idk what to add. There is some small things in pve that is quite good, like for example whisper of the worm quest, but its a minority, and roughly like 10% of the pve content.Now, about this seasonal content. New season comes every 3 months, and costs 10$, you may not buy it, but then you wont get access to seasonal story(it takes ~30min to 1 hour to clear seasonal story, summarized, as story quests comes out throughout the season), seasonal armor\\guns, skins, shaders, e.t.c. Well, basically almost nothing, except 1 out of 2 seasonal exotics, seasonal armor with trash stats, and 1 seasonal legendary weapon, which is a joke. All in all i found myself it is pointless to play the game after you cleared the main story, without buying season as you wont getting almost any new content, and even if you only play pvp, you still wanna buy season access, as for example in current season new pulse-rifle is pretty good in pvp, so keep that in mind, when you looking at F2P tag.Oh, there is also mode that combines PVP and PVE called Gambit, but majority of playerbase hates it, and for a good reason, and does it only for rewards, which only adds to a hatred(i remember myself grinding 21% delirium, and now i get it why its called so(mindbender sends their regards))And the worse thing happened to a game lately, IMO, is \"weapon retirement\" which somehow also became \"armor retirement\". Ok, i can get the idea behind weapon retirement, but i still find this just a lazy approach to balancing things, but armor retirement... Well, armor isnt some complex thing that is hard to balance, its just a freaking \"stat stick\", with same stats that doesnt need any balancing. So why? Forcing players to grind for new armor? For more resources? ffs...And its not the only thing like this, devs going in this direction lately, they calling it \"players incentive\", while i prefer to call it a load of bs, and adding even more grind to already grindy game.P.S. Sorry if my english is bad, i planned to write some very short review, but then this wall of text happened, lol.And i also really wanted to give this game a thumbs up, at least for it being a MMO with a soul, which is rare, but sadly i just cant. Also, i couldve said, that there is pretty good graphics, the game is well optimised, visual design is awesome, as well as soundtrack, e.t.c., but its all doesnt matter if the game is hollow beyond main story line.", "Author": "Rero", "Hours": 881.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: June 27, 2020", "Review": "bungie has been stepping on my balls since destiny 1, new light was an absolute schizodream trying to complete, making me have to do a multicharacter process to fix being not able to decode umbrel engrams", "Author": "golf rumors", "Hours": 460.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: June 27, 2020", "Review": "Yes", "Author": "its_KSC", "Hours": 3353.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: June 27, 2020", "Review": "with the right group.. this game will last forever", "Author": "Fahad7", "Hours": 2418.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: June 27, 2020", "Review": "Its fun if you play with your friends but the monetization in this game is extremely predatory.

Destiny 2 brings together a special kind of people that become such a tightly knit community. On top of all that the game itself has thousands of hours of playtime in just the base game and with new seasons and DLC coming out every year that playtime only gets extended further and further. There is almost limitless potential in Destiny 2 whether it be earning your place in the crucible, creating wacky fun character builds, conquering the most challenging activities like grandmaster nightfalls, speedrunning, raiding, exploration on planets, secret missions, gambit, and so much more.

They just announced that they will be removing about half of the game, parts of which people, myself included have paid for. Nothing is stoping them from doing this again and again in the future, making this a very bad investment. Its almost like if they busted into my house to take back halo 2 now that the new MCC PC version is out. 2. The sale of the Bring Light Delux edition is (perhaps purposely) misleading. Quite a few people thought they were purchasing 4 season passes, including the one for this season. Not everyone is paying attention to what season # it is, and while it states seasons 12-15, its not made clear that season 12 is in 4 months. This means that youll also have to buy the season pass for this season for 10$ (flying in the face of all logic and intuition) after dropping 70$ on what you thought was this seasons seasons content.

For me, the highlight has always been raids and the PvE experience, but since Beyond Light the PvP experience has been the best its been! (Outside of a few issues with the new stasis subclasses.) The whole game has plenty of ups and downs, good decisions and bad decisions, but at the end of the day the game is fine.If you like looter shooters like Warframe, Borderlands, or just FPS games in general, youll like this. Its biggest downside is a thing known as \"sunsetting\" which essentially means that every gear has a cap to how long youll be able to use it. Typically though, this time is about a year before its gone for good. Its primarily done to increase player incentive to grind for the new stuff and power-check the new stuff that gets released as well. Overall though, If you take the dive, youll have fun.I will say one thing though. The free-to-play experience is... worse than it used to be. I would highly suggest purchasing Beyond Light ($50 but has the most relevant content), Forsaken ($20-ish and has some good exotics), or the current season thats out (which is typically $10 and gives you access to the newest stuff and some cosmetics). Shadowkeep is expensive while not having much relevant gear for you to obtain, so dont waste your money on it unless youve already purchased the other two and want more content. The free-to-play feels a lot like a demo, sort of saying \"Hey, if you like this, then youll like it even more if you buy the expansions!\" which sucks, but you can still have fun with it!(Note: Now Edited after Beyond Light!)", "Author": "Bean", "Hours": 2353.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 19, 2020", "Review": "Its almost comical how bad this game is yet makes you play it because of the small amount of addicting aspects akin to a casino that takes all your money and causes you alcohol dependency problems but you still go back.", "Author": "Mr. Shoe", "Hours": 1153.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 18, 2020", "Review": "Zavala chose you to suck his nuts, dont make him regret it.", "Author": "YungLabiya", "Hours": 384.1}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 19, 2020", "Review": "Very good game 11/10, abit upset tho, as i have accumulated 400+ hours whilst being stuck inside due to coronavirus, and i havent gotten the Itsy Bitsy Spider Ornament kit for my recluse this makes me very sad because when i get it i will without a shadow of a doubt get flawless every week in trials of osiris, mark my words bungie!!!!!XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD", "Author": "Resentment", "Hours": 3078.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 18, 2020", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "xKING_CITYx", "Hours": 642.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 17, 2020", "Review": "way too many hours in this game but wouldnt change it for the world.", "Author": "Scottyboxx", "Hours": 898.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 17, 2020", "Review": "i love this game a lot ", "Author": "Onesecondahead", "Hours": 155.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 16, 2020", "Review": "NO ", "Author": "Robert Anderson", "Hours": 369.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 16, 2020", "Review": "i only played a few hours, sokay i guess", "Author": "milo0", "Hours": 2927.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: May 16, 2020", "Review": "Good game to play with friends.

The story is OK at best and downright confusing AF at its worst, also super short (only took me 5 hours to beat the main story and 4 for Forsaken. Shadowkeep about the same as Forsaken)Before I forget to mention it, if you dont get Forsaken or Shadowkeep (almost the price of a full game might I add) Your only getting about 50 hours worth of content and im being very VERY generous with that statement.The gameplay is great but be can be highly repetitive when playing solo.Are you mainly a solo player? Sorry once you hit a certain point in the game theres a lot of activities that you just simply cant do, limiting your ability to min-max or to get the specific gear that you want for your build.In my personal opinion the game is jolly good fun until you reach this point (which was around after 150-200 hours of grinding out the exotics I could get solo)You might be asking yourself \"Hey dumbass if you stopped having fun at 200 hours in, why do you have almost 500 hours on your account?\" Well let me put it to you this way.  I HAD A CLAN A clan will increases the lifespan of this game for you tremendously by hundreds of hours. Theres so many more activities that you are able to do because of it its insane, plus youll be able to get the best gear grinding it out together instead of tearing your eyes out doing it solo. But wait little Timmy said, \"If that was the case than why are you not recommending this game if you had fun playing it?\" The answer is simple, burnout. The game has been suffering from this issue in my opinion for a very long time. Quite a few D2 youtubers have covered this subject.Overall, if you are a solo player and have never tried it, go ahead and give it a go, but I dont suggest buying anything for this game whatsoever. There are other games worth your hard earned $50 that can give you so much more entertainment. If you have a group of friends who you want to jump in with or who already have done everything in the game, by all means go ahead. Although I still dont suggest buying Forsaken or Shadowkeep until youve gotten through the base game content. That way you already have a feel for the style and can make an educated decision on purchasing these two DLC.I loved my time with the game but in the current state I cannot in my right mind tell someone that they couldnt buy better games with the price it would cost you to truly unlock what D2 is.Thank you for your time, if you have any more direct questions feel free to ask(Update is just formatting stuff to separate the talking points, you know how that is)", "Author": "Pu1sarN0va\u8109\u51b2\u661f", "Hours": 722.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: April 21, 2020", "Review": "I have been playing Destiny since the closed Beta of Destiny 1.

It is not without its faults though, and I\u2019ll write a small summary of that towards the end of the review.The Story:Back in Destiny 1 Vanilla, the story felt very disjointed and fragmented. Turns out this was a byproduct of a late-development restructure of how the game\u2019s story was being told. A lot of the story in Destiny 1 was online in the form of lore stories. As the expansions came and went and a new game was released, Bungie got better at putting the story in game. Their storytelling was still lackluster in Destiny 2 Vanilla, with corny one-liners and poorly placed humor. However, Fall 2018 brought the \u201cForsaken\u201d expansion to the game and delivered one of the best storylines from the series (in my opinion). Their season storylines of 2019-2020 are \u201calright\u201d but really lacking any meat and the way they try to connect the story season to season feels rather forced or unclear most of the time. The Activities and things to do:The main activities available in the game are Strikes, Crucible, Gambit, and Raids. On the surface these main core activities cover a large area of things to do, but the depth of some of the activities is pretty shallow.Strikes have two main ways to be played, either a normal rotation of all strikes, or a weekly featured \u201cordeal nightfall\u201d strike. The ordeal nightfall ramps up the difficulty of enemies and adds modifiers to the gameplay to make things tougher, as well as adding a specific piece of loot as a rare(ish) drop from finishing the activity.Crucible is the game\u2019s PvP mode, and has plenty of gametypes to play, with more conventional modes always available and some of the more unique ones rotate weekly. They also recently re-introduced their pinnacle PvP activity \u201cTrials of Osiris.\u201d It is a 3v3, elimination-styled, PvP mode where the goal is to go \u201cFlawless\u201d to get the best of the best rewards. Going flawless requires winning 7 games without losing a single match. It is not an activity for the average player usually, but it gives those more interested in PvP a goal to reach. Overall, the balancing for Crucible is always in a state of flux where some things always creep towards being OP. Bungie has always had a rough time balancing Pvp in Destiny, but the current meta is relatively fine.Gambit is a hybrid PvEvP gamemode, where the goal is to kill enemies and increase a score, leading to a boss being summoned that your team needs to kill. The PvP involves invading the other team\u2019s arena and killing the enemy team, lowering their total available points. The gamemode is in a weird spot for me where it\u2019s not a super poorly designed game mode, but it feels like a chore to play.Raids are the pinnacle of the PvE experience, or at least they\u2019re supposed to be. Raids have some of the most complex mechanics out of any PvE activity and there are only very subtle hints as to how you\u2019re supposed to complete each encounter. They are 6 person, non-matchmade activities that have offered some of the most enjoyable experiences I\u2019ve had in this series. As of writing this, Bungie has only released one raid this content year. Compared to this point of last year\u2019s content cycle, we would have had two raids that were relevant for grinding loot in.The \u201cFeel\u201d of the Game:As an avid FPS player, this game just feels more fluid than other games I\u2019ve played. The movement abilities don\u2019t feel clunky and the guns/recoil feel amazing, even with a controller or on consoles. It excels at making the gun and abilities flow together easily in the midst of battle.The Ugly:Eververse. Eververse is Destiny\u2019s microtransaction cosmetics store. It is hands down the worst thing about this game. It is the parasite that sucks the life out of the game. On top of the paid content being lighter this year and a lot of things feeling repurposed or reskinned, Eververse is the one thing that gets new and fresh things added to it constantly. It would be excusable if it\u2019s overabundantly prioritized presence brought about more frequent updates or actually fund \u201cnew\u201d pieces of content, but it feels like it is just there to take our money without giving much benefit in return to the player. To give it some benefit of the doubt it is, as of right now, only providing players with fancy looking cosmetics for their characters. But that is part of the problem because it is the ONLY real source of consistently fresh and fancy cosmetics. When looking at Eververse it feels like Bungie only sees me as my wallet, and not as a player. Overall, the core game is really good and it is only the microtransactions that are \u201cbad\u201d with the game.Summing things up:With a good chunk of the game being free to play, there\u2019s no reason for me to not say try Destiny 2. I\u2019ve found many hours of enjoyment and met some of my best friends through this game. The new player experience is pretty disjointed and confusing but if you can work your way through that and get an understanding of the game, you\u2019ll find that it can actually be a ton of fun (hopefully). The microtransactions, however bad I feel them to be, are not forced and you can ignore them if you wish. Overall, this series has given me countless hours of gameplay and even though it is currently going through a rough patch there is always hope for it to return to an age of greatness. Definitely try it out if you have the time, you\u2019ll likely not regret it. I also overshot my goal time played for when to review by 1.9 hours, which is because i was having a blast playing the game and forgot to keep track of the time.

The cons are that its the most new player unfriendly game i have ever played, you log in for the first and you are bombarded with quests and information that you have no idea what to do with and you are given zero to no help, the game has a 30-40 day dry season where you have nothing to do than hunt seals which are extremely hard and tedious.

Amazing Graphics2. Best Multiplayer Game3. Great Story4. New seasons and Game content every ( 4 months I believe )5. Lots of Quests And Missions to complete6. Unique And exotic Guns ( My personal deal breaker )Few drawbacks of the game.1. Playing Solo sucks in few Missions. And definitely need some friends or have to join a clan.2. Many Raids are there which requires at least 4-6 people to do which kinda backs for Solo players .

This season has a lot to live up to, so lets get going. Last season was extremely mediocre by the end. Im surprised I even finished the season pass. Last season was a break time for some Doom time for me. However, on August 24th (2021), Bungie revealed the Witch Queen... and the hype was amazing. And while we wait for the release, they gave us this season: Season of the Lost. Focusing primarily on the Dreaming City (a location that many people love, myself included), Bungie brought back the good old seasonal activities and exotic quests that Season 13 introduced. Also Mara Sovs back, and who could hate her?CROSSPLAY... is amazing! The entire Destiny community has been waiting for this. Theyve made it so simple too: the first platform you log into this season will be your Bungie name. Example: on Steam, my username is Dracolyte. While on Xbox, its Dracolyte4547. I logged on Xbox first (cause I was stupid lol) and now my bungie name is Dracolyte4547. They add four digits after your username so there is no username taken problem. It shows all your friends on all platforms and you can immediately get playing. Simple. No new raids this season, but none were expected or needed. However they might release a new one mid-season, but thats unlikely. I wont mind if they dont.Astrial Alignment is... great! Better then the Battlegrounds of Season 13 even. You fight waves of Scorn and Taken while doing 1 of 2 objectives. My favorite one is where you kill the taken captains and pickup their taken essence... and you essentially have a taken super. Its awesome. The bossfights at the end are fun, and I dont see this getting old anytime soon.The Shattered Realm is back, as its own solo activity. Its a great place to explore, there are many secrets scattered around, and its easy to get lost in. But its a nice new activity, much better then Expunge.The story is much more interesting then the previous season. I wont say any spoilers though, so youll have to check it out for yourself.PVP HAS BEEN FIXXED!!!! Bungie incorporated the BattlEye launcher to fix cheating, and completely revamped Trials with matchmaking, and it is massively more enjoyable. I assume massive amounts of players will be coming back or fresh joining again. Lorentz Driver, the seasonal weapon, is pretty great. Its a linear fusion rifle, something the game needed a lot more exotics of. Essentially, when you kill an enemy, it spawns a void black hole that sucks them in and then explodes. Its pretty great.I almost forgot to mention the Legendary STASIS WEAPONS! Theyre awesome! Vulpecula is one of my all time favorite hand cannons for pvp. Its a low recoil, 180 rpm hand cannon that rolls with amazing perks. Fractethyst is a great pvp-pve shotgun that also has great perks. Reed\u2019s Regret (which I dont yet have) I have heard is an amazing linear fusion, and I have seen some gameplay videos of it and it looks great. They also added old Trials of the Nine weapons to Prophecy, like Judgement, making it much more interesting. And free!Wrappin it up: Is the season worth it? Absolutely. Rewarding. Fun. Actually worth the grind. Crossplay is here, and the fun has just begun.

Slightly awkward to get used to, but if you play with the different styles of double and triple jump I think anyone can get a feel for the nuances of movement in this surprisingly polished title.

Ever since Shadowkeep Destiny has been going downhill, their first mistake was the three-month seasonal content and the half-arsed Shadowkeep DLC which could have breathed more life into Destinys world. Imagine, factions hear about the Pyramid and set out to gathering guardians to their side. Through that, we couldve had faction progress bars based upon the community. It would set back the release date for Shadowkeep no doubt. But imagine how wonderful it would have been to have Dead Orbit, FWC and New Monarchy all going head to head in information warfare. Then maybe you couldve had Rasputin rise with his Seven Seraph gear and take matters into his own hands for a layered story on top of the base game, bringing together the community in an exciting style of guardian war. I digress.The Vex offensive was okay. Less than mediocre and far less than stellar. Uninteresting and only minorly linked to the story via the Garden of Salvation raid.Through the campaign of Shadowkeep, we are nagged, chivvied and harassed by Eris Morn that the Darkness is coming. So what do we do? We bring back Saint-14, reasonable. But then the Darkness, the Devil itself, the winnower of the pattern does nothing. Theyve been moving over for two and a half bloody years, and they do nothing. We do nothing to prepare, and for whatever purpose as Guardians we dont think that The Almighty left hanging around in our solar system could never be a problem with the vengeful Cabal running around freely. And they wonder why we dont like the ever-watchful Zavala on the tower standing thinking, this is fine.Now the season of the unworthy, a PVP season in a PVE game with next to no anti-cheat. Where Gandalf the grey flies around the menagerie and makes Calus empty a barrel of mead while complaining about the neckbeards and children that shoot his cups. Because now, this one will do it infinitely with a thousand voices that sound like a million, and Ten. Ive heard time and time again, \"Read the lore.\" but I refuse to give Bungie even a moment of my diminished playtime to reading the lore theyre too lazy to implement in the game. Their storytelling has gotten lazier and lazier with every moment of development put into the game. They expect us to go to YouTubers with nothing better to do who will tell us why we should give a solitary \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about their piss poor it didnt happen until it did or we are your salvation lines that mean absolutely nothing. Im comin home, Ace. has no emotional impact on us because they didnt even bother to tell us that Caydes son was called Ace in the story. This game could have been beautiful if Bungie were not careless. And now my simple review of \"Ill make you rich sister, Trust.\" has turned to Eight hundred and twenty-six words due to the piss poor execution of Shadowkeep and Im not even done yet.Shadowkeep gave us the moon again with the addition of two strikes, a raid, a dungeon and an exotic. Forsaken gave us Tangled Shore, The Dreaming City and the yearly seasons gave us far more on top. But Shadowkeep was one of the laziest additions to date, In The Dreaming City, Bungie presented us with architecture so beautiful and one of the most magnificent raids to date. Providing us reason to bloody ourselves to save this beguiling antediluvian city. You dont need to tell me The Dreaming City is eloquent. I can bloody see it. Like a song, you dont describe a song to your friend; you make him sit his arse down so he can hear what its all about.In Shadowkeep were kept tight to bounties, and a lacklustre campaign that sets our curiosity ablaze with the reskinned moon, Hive and Nightmares to then be given \"We are your salvation.\" from a copy of ourselves.  Then the majority of the community who wants content to matter will wait for My Name is Byf to tell them why they should care. But dont worry, the Darkness is going to chill in space while we party. Thats right, The Devil itself, Shaitan breathing down your neck, The monsters from the great Darkness of The Beyond. They are going to relax in space while we have the Olympic, indolently designed, games of bounties while Gandalf flies, gatling snipes and teleports his way up the Lighthouse while PVE players starve.

With a multitude of other games (Halo, Fallen Order, etc) available now, theres becoming a lot of competitors to take players away from destiny, and for me, its worked. 7/10, Solid Game, just gets boring quick and really doesnt pick up until new paid content is released", "Author": "S3", "Hours": 1767.0}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: December 4, 2019", "Review": "Update: As of 10/21/2021 Bungie has announced plans to remove even more content that players paid for and some are still farming to this day for god roll weapons, they are continuously lazy about balancing pvp leaving months of the more competitive game mode in a state that feels absolutely awful to play, and they are moving to force people in the direction of the deluxe edition if they want access to the nightfalls that will be associated with the upcoming dungeons.  If they wanted to hike the price of the base game up and let people purchase the seasons at their leisure that would be fine but to put people in the position where they HAVE to buy the deluxe edition even if they might walk away from the game 2 seasons in is messed up.  I know that for Shadowkeep I just put the game down around Season of the Worthy because...there just wasnt anything really driving me to play the game at the time.  Ive been saying for a while now that the separation from Activision was not a positive change for Bungie, and that Bungie has seemed lazier and more resistant to constructive criticism than ever.  The fact that they were told a weapon that is essentially a heavy weapons wasnt fun to play against as it made sure that you entered engagements in a weakened state and their reply was along the lines of \"just adapt\" still blows my mind.Also a D1 vet and I would have to say that if you need a game that will take hundreds of hours to catch up in then get D2.  From the time the game switched over to steam I put in 278 hours and I purchased the $60 pack so if youre going by dollar per hour thats like 21 cents per hour.  Theres moments where the game will frustrate you, and moments where youll be blown away by what it has to offer.  But like many games when youre caught up and there isnt much left to do youll start to pick apart the issues associated with the game.  A heads up for players who are interested in PvP is that the game isnt balanced and for those not interested in PvP the developers will lock weapons behind PvP participation.  The meta especially on PC is relatively inflexible and will remain as such until Bungie decides they want to balance pvp more frequently.  Of course skilled players can make things work but give a skilled player a meta weapon and they become extremely dominant.  Not to mention that RNG kinda determines the efficacy of certain weapons like shotguns.  Overall its a fun game that will connect you with people, and provide hours of entertainment if you take the time to learn and go through old content.  As a franchise Destiny has chewed up thousands of hours of my time, and although I regret it on some level there are moments of genuine enjoyment that I would have missed out on.Update: Early 2020 Bungie dropped the ball, and if youre sick of that type of crap from Bungie then dont touch this game.  If you dont mind the fact that the season pass model is kinda a rip off then buy the game and be warned youll probably get so burned out that you wont get your moneys worth.  The whole, \"play the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of our game until you cant stand it so that you unlock everything on the pass\" formula is ok for about one season.Update: Late 2021 I have discovered that in order to get one season I would have to pay the price of all the seasons combined even if I didnt want to play all of them.  On top of that the 30th anniversary event is essentially locked off from a good portion of players and all the weapons people really want are held back for the people willing to shell out the money.  Someone once told me that D2 was P2W and at the time I didnt agree...months later there are so many things that give you an advantage that require you to shell out big bucks to obtain.  Hawkmoon, Duality, Gjallerhorn, Eyesluna, 1k Stare (arguably the best sniper in the game currently), DMT, etc.  I understood them locking exotics even if those exotics were absurdly strong but now they are locking legendary weapons as well and it proves that they can sink lower.  At this point the only reason I keep playing is out of hope that Bungie will revamp their monetization strategy, and the fact that there is almost nothing out there like Destiny.  I highly recommend people who are considering this game stay away.", "Author": "OspreyBravo18", "Hours": 1436.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 3, 2019", "Review": "I love this game so much.

It was pretty damn badly designed, and it was not worth its price tag (or should I say PRICE TAGS) up until Forsaken. But post Forsaken destiny 2 is pretty good. In fact, Id say Forsaken was the true release of the game, and hopefully getting away from activision will make the game even better. Without wasting words, lets get right to business.+Great visuals. The game looks great, even now, and does not look dated at all. In fact, the art style ensures that it will age well even years down the road.+Plenty of content, especially if you dont care about the meta, and just enjoy hunting those trophies and collecting everything you can possibly get your hands on. Even if youre just going to play the f2p base game version, you will find plenty of activities.+Excellently handled difficulty. No matter if youre a casual player or a seasoned FPS veteran, you will find content where you will be challenged+Gunplay feels great+Movement feels smooth and responsive+If you like looters, you will feel at home+Decent PvPHowever, theres some issues too. Pretty big ones. -Monetization. Gonna let the cat out of the bag immediately. Even though they split off activision, the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 continues. Theres expansions to buy, and theres season passes to buy. Thats not my main issue. My main issue is the in-game shop, the Eververse. Ironically, while they were under activision, you used to get cash shop items pretty consistently in form of bright engrams. These engrams contained items that are in the cash shop, however, now theres only NOSTALGIC ENGRAMS, which only contains old cash shop stuff, effectively paywalling a good chunk of new cosmetic content. Did anyone complain about bright engrams? No. Did they need to be converted into crappy, unexciting nostalgic engrams? Hell no. Why did they do it? Well, gotta milk the players somehow. Another scummy thing is how bright dust (a currency that can be obtained in-game, with which you can buy SOME of the rotating cosmetic content in the Eververse shop) is handled now. Long story short, the amount of bright dust you can get at reasonable pace is pretty damn limited. Theyre mostly tied to weekly bounties. Theres some repeatable bounties you can do, but the amount of dust you get from it is pathetic, and its simply unreasonable to expect that you can farm up dust for something you want via repeatable bounties. -Cosmetic customization. Its pretty damn pathetic that at THE CURRENT YEAR, theres still no transmog/vanity armor slots/similar cosmetic customization that allows you to use the appearance of the armor you collected, rather than plainly equipping it, with stats and all. Especially in a damned LOOTER, which has hundreds of armor pieces you can collect. Come on now, even decade forgotten MMOs are doing it at this point, what is YOUR excuse, bungie? Oh, right. Gotta sell eververse universal ornaments somehow.And before some idiot starts blabbering \"its just cosmetix\" about these two points I made, cosmetics ARE important. People want to look as good as they can while kicking ass, and its ESPECIALLY important in looter type games. Youre delusional if you try to say its not important. -Content recycling. This one is kinda understandable, splitting from activision might hold them back for a while, but I have to mention it anyway. The recent expansion, Shadowkeep, was a pretty big recycle of old content. Not saying it was bad, revisiting places from Destiny 1 can be pretty neat, but it has to be said. Lets hope they have something surprising in store for us soon.-PvP seems pretty damn abandoned at current time. Cant even get consistent shards. Meta, with these \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 one punch, one eyed mask titans, is pretty annoying. Throw us, crucible guardians, a bone already. Overall, the game in its core is pretty great. It has issues, yes, but it vastly improved over its launch state. Hopefully its only a road to greatness from now on. At first glance, it might look that I went pretty hard on this game, but its just because I had to go on detail about its negatives, while the positives are self explanatory and you will see it for yourself. Bad start aside, bungie put a lot of love into this game, at it shows. And now that the base game is free to play, you have nothing to lose if you try it (well, other than those poor gigabytes of your hard drive). All they have to do to have an excellent game, is to continue polishing it, adding interesting variety of content, and stop going down the path of activision when it comes to monetization.", "Author": "Laytnor", "Hours": 569.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 3, 2019", "Review": "A good game to grind loot and play with friends :)", "Author": "torarz", "Hours": 455.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 3, 2019", "Review": "h", "Author": "Mortenero", "Hours": 1118.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "if you like the shoot and loot, buy the doot doot 2", "Author": "Barcoptimus Ryot", "Hours": 3408.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "Stupid question... hell yes i would.", "Author": "shambles75", "Hours": 2859.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "please give me my wife backi miss her other than that its a good game", "Author": "scei", "Hours": 1873.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "A Nice Open World Game , very good action play , well done !", "Author": "Today_Hero", "Hours": 104.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "Yes", "Author": "Captain Raccoon", "Hours": 180.0}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "its still garbage.", "Author": "Yiro", "Hours": 3613.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "Muy buen juego, pvp algo t\u00f3xico pero divertido.", "Author": "Dabulla", "Hours": 1937.0}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "better play with friends . have no friends . 10/10 . edit 11/2021: still no friends :(", "Author": "\u00b7 egus", "Hours": 1146.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "Bungie splitting up with Activision was a damn good decision.Also, Moon is haunted.", "Author": "Ph4nToM", "Hours": 175.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "Since day one in Destiny 1 my favorite game!", "Author": "Stoner", "Hours": 1122.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "quite gud", "Author": "Allison", "Hours": 173.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "i havent talk to a female in over 4 years", "Author": "Invader", "Hours": 2193.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 1, 2019", "Review": "Best game good grinding", "Author": "\u7231bi\u306eYangz", "Hours": 754.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 1, 2019", "Review": "the game just never fails to astonish me... its best if played with friends!!!", "Author": "Kitetsu", "Hours": 39.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 2, 2019", "Review": "This game is a true master piece, with the music and the truly incredible amount of lore behind each individual enemy and friendly vendors.

Last time (you can find what I wrote under) I was very disappointed. So in that matter nothing has changed. Im even more disappointed then I was before.So lets go to the points.CHEATERS & BUNGIE - they dont care at all about cheaters, now you will meet them in all activities from normal Crucible, Gambit to ofc Trials. I dont know how it could happening still. So all PvP aspect of that game is ruined.Grandmaster - same story as before, dont waste ur time, they dont even put effort to change the look of the BADGE for that seasons Grandmaster NFs! Its the same ugly thing like before, NOTHING was done to change it!Season of Arrival - season of \"NOTHING NEW, LETS PUT SOME NEW EXOTIC AND SOME STUPID A** QUEST\". They dont put any effort to add more content again we go threw the same thing \"pick up quest, do planetary event, go to \"special\" location, thats all for the week\". All content from that season for this moment (3.08.2020) is boring as hell, its nothing new at all. What we gonna do till 10.11.2020?!?!!?!? BUNGIE - It is so funny when it comes to \"SELLING SILVER\" and things connected with it they will fix it ASAP even faster, and that how it was with \"Felwinters Lie\" release, quest was bugged, but \"WHAT ABOUT THE SKINS FOR SILVER?!?!?! WE NEED T FIX IS ASAP!!!!\" it was fixed very fast because there were risk about not selling enough silver to buy new skin. It is terrible how they are treating us loyal gamers!! Many my friends who are playing Destiny since day 1, they quit the game, taking a break cause there is nothing to do, only CASH GRAB from bungie.WE NEED MORE CONTENT TO PLAY!! NOT MORE ITEMS FOR SILVER!!and one more word, if anyone would say they need to earn etc, ofc they do, but please give us things to do too!btw. I spent a lot for silver to support them, but nowadays I dont even want to do it anymore!Old review: (around 1400h)\"I really like that game, but with introducing of Season Of The Worthy and its activities I need to change my review.1. Trials of Osiris - Full of cheaters, people who got smg snipers, self resses etc, nothing is done to fix it. Cause of it all of the cheaters fell free to abuse people in other activities too.2. Grandmaster NF - if you dont want to cheat or cheese, forget about it. It was made for ppl who cheese it, record video and publish it on youtube, thats all. And dont say its not like that, cause many ppl try to do it \"normal\" way and they fail. Or maybe it is normal for you to glitch encounters, skip monsters etc then GL.3. Bunkers - no loot at LLS, nothing to do after being forced for 3 weeks to complete event possible to do in 7 days.4. Guardian games - kind of joke, titan and warlocks glitching event to win, after 1 week nothing left to do, sorry only weekly mission for ghost shell, wow.If the next season will be the same many ppl will just give up on it.Posted 30 November, 2019.

This game, the developers, and the community, have come such a long way since we heard our first \"Eyes up.\"I have easily over a thousand total hours in Destiny 2 across both Steam and the Blizzard launcher, it is without question my most played game ever, and for good reason. There are some major points that Im going to cover in this review, the things that I personally think are the best qualities of Destiny 2, and they are as follows: 1: Gunplay    Destiny 2 has some of the best feeling gunplay I have ever experienced in an FPS game, by that I mean that shooting guns is hella fun. Each weapon feels unique, and due to perks and randomized rolls, even two of the same gun can feel different to use. And above all, no matter what, theyre all  satisfying  to use. Cracking that headshot, gunning down a room of Thrall, it all feels good to do, no matter how many times you do it. Destiny certainly doesnt have the most realistic gun mechanics ever, almost every weapon is hitscan and has at least a bit of aim assist,  but lets be honest, if you wanted realism, you wouldnt be looking at a game about undead Light warriors fighting a space war against bug people, robots, and space rhinos.  2: Story    The story of this game is immense, and encompasses more than just what you experience through gameplay. Believe me when I say this game universe has the most incredible stories, be it small one off lore blips you find from reviving dead ghosts, or the continuing massive intertwining storylines that are still ongoing. The lore about this game is one of my favorite things to read in my free time when Im not playing. (and if you dont want to take my word for it, look some of it up, even if you dont play the game, the lore behind it is still incredible on its own) 3: Music    The music in Destiny is one of the most overlooked things about it. The soundtracks for this game are without a doubt in my top 5 for best game music ever. Every piece of music fits so well for the location that it plays, or the enemy race that its connected to. It perfectly rides the razors edge between being so fitting you barely notice it, and being so good that you cant ignore it. 4: Community    The last bit Ill bring up about this game is the outstanding sense of community that it has. From dozens of people making a conga line of flaming tables in the Tower, to a random max Light Guardian make a Public Event heroic then stomping the boss into dust to help out a kinderguardian, the interactions between players are hilarious and beautiful. Outside of the game, there are massive LFG communities, Raid Sherpas, quest guides, infographics, lore theorizing and secret-cracking subreddits, art sharing, the list goes on. Every time I log in I see something that restores a little faith in humanity, and thats not something I can say about most games. In conclusion...    I love everything about this game and this community, and I cannot sing it enough praise. If you want to get into the game, but dont know where to start, send me a message, Id be happy to help you with anything you need. Whether its questions about basic game mechanics, or stuff like raids, or lore or whatever, Ill do my best to help you go from kinderguardian to Godslayer. Eyes up Guardians, see you starside.

The game has been in a really rough spot for a while. The core of the game is grinding for loot, except this loot has become worthless. Exotics require a long, tedious grind of doing the same activities over and over to get a weapon youll use for a few minutes and quickly set aside. To decent legendary gear also requires a similar tedious grind of even harder activities, only for said legendary gear to not even matter in the end because that piece of gear is gonna get sunsetted, forcing you to do the exact same grind for another piece of gear thats barely any different just to replace it.Many destinations and all the content tied to them are being removed from the game to make room for new content. They say they are going to re-add it in the future. To do this though, theyll have to remove even more content. People have said Bungie has been recycling content for years, but this is a whole new level. Removing destinations overtime to make room for new ones, only to remove more to make room for the ones you just removed while locking all the content for them behind a season pass.Making a good chunk of the game free to play was a slap in the face for people who bought it originally, me being one of them, but I can understand from a developers point of view why would do that. Now they are removing nearly all the content free to play players can access, only to re-add it later behind a season pass. Imagine charging players to access something, only to remove it for a while and re-add it in the future, then charging you AGAIN for it. This is some of the most horrific design choices I have ever seen from a developer.Destiny is a trap. Their trailers and posts promise an epic experience running around with your space magic and guns, when in reality its an underwhelming, lackluster chore of grinding the same thing over and over, and now recently that grinding is becoming worthless. The community expresses their disappoint at Bungie, they promise theyll change, they announce their big new wonderful DLC or season that will change the game forever and redeem themselves, they drop a cool trailer, everyone throws their money at Bungie only for the cycle to continue. Its honestly an abusive relationship. Promising to change and be better for the contents of your wallet. For years I have thrown my money at Bungie after believing them when they say theyre making all these wonderful changes to make the game better and theyve learned from their mistakes, only to get stabbed in the back when I discover the cycle has repeated, and now that money is gone. Theyve made it very clear they wont change. I shamefully admit I have spent well over 200 dollars buying every DLC in Destiny 1 and the majority of them in Destiny 2. A good chunk of that 200 dollars has been wasted. After shadowkeep I was fed up, I havent bought any of the seasons and I dont regret it one bit.Ive gotten out of the trap. I advise you do the same.TL;DR: The game is nothing but a chore of tedious grinding of the same activities over and over, much of that grinding is worthless because of sunsetting and exotics being \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, now Bungie is entering a new stage of literally recycling content for money. This game has some of the most horrific design choices I have ever witnessed.I absolutely cannot recommend this game in its current state.

I cannot deny I enjoy this game and my hours reflect that. I also cannot deny the gameplay is fun.But my overall experience from what i can get is the general idea of looter shooters and games in service. Sure I can say its fun, but this type of game has littered the whole face of games in the world with the same boring mechanics of RNG drops and typical raids or \"elite\" modes in games. Games like DESTINY 2 already exist like The Division series, Warframe, Anthem , Plan 8, upcoming Outriders. they all share the same basis. Sure i could say its fun, the shooting mechanics are fun, but the whole premise of the game is so repetitive now you could feel it in other games now.Theres nothing new here to explore and the past 2 seasons is about time travel or some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about \"revisitting\" the past by reintroducing locations from the first game.I genuinely feel like this game is honestly a waste of time from a long term point, because after you get the loot. Theres not much to do really. Thats how PVE games live and die. But then i like warframe even though it doesnt have an endgame nor difficulty rewarding loot. Why?I hate bringing warframe to a DESTINY 2 game review,but i found warframes methods of trying to add new content refreshing, sure it could end up repetitive and grinded , but how Railjack is a whole new game mode, and they keep trying new things out- taking risks. I love it. DESTINY 2 isnt any of that, Season of Dawn and the Season of Undying content that is worth is about the mild small lore and exotics, but nothing to add to the mediocre universe and lore or even- something mechanically new. Its all generic shooter, its fun and addictive, but its not new.It doesnt help to the fact the content is time gated with \"limitted\" things each season, theres not much to see here if you wanna seek for something new, but if youre a long time warframe player and wants to try DESTINY 2 out, sure! Go for it, nothing is stopping you.The main reason im not recommending this game is the fact it brings nothing new to the table, its another looter shooter in another pool of looter shooters. Could it be better in the future? Sure.But im bored of it, I dont lie, i barely touched the raids, but theres nothing that drew me to play it.Maybe Im just angry for no reason.

If you have not had the opportunity to try Destiny this is the time. With free to play you can jump right in solo or with friends and venture an amazing universe. The Destiny community is thriving and continuing to grow. Destiny 2 did have a rocky launch with ACTIVISION on the Blizzard launcher but Bungie is no longer partnered with ACTIVISION giving Bungie more control and freedom. This FPS/RPG looter shooter is one of the best of its kind in the genre, hands down. You will always have something to grind for, search for or accomplish. The games content consist of PVP events, festive events, PvE events, dungeons raids and tons of open world activities.  The game wants you to explore and do everything meaning you will have some quest that require to do a raid or a PVE quest may require you to do PVP and I know that bothers so people. Overall the game is amazing for what it is and what it is trying to be.

The developers are more then willing to listen to the playerbase and to everyone whos opinions are voiced in a rational way (very rarely does unfounded anger get anywhere here!) Because of that we have a lot of communication and reasoning for the choices made. A TON of the game is free right now, and the entire map is totally open even if you dont have that areas related DLC just so new players can play with their friends. Not all the content, no. But it still opens the map and exploration. The guns and armor that have been plaguing the game are getting curbed in the right places where they feel good but arent stomping.

I played it way too much. Destiny 2 at launch was...less impressive. I sort of assumed it was because Activision was throttling Bungie, forcing them to cut effort to push micro-transactions. Now that Bungie escaped Activisions clutches, everything is great, right?Not really.For starters, Bungie doubled-down on microtransactions and the cash shop. Most of the development effort goes into real-money items. Shadowkeep and the Season of the Undying is a good example; the expansion itself is literally just a pile of reused assets with a story behind it. \"You have to fight the ghosts of all these old bosses again! Spooky!\" The season is just reskinned garbage and extremely depressing \"evolving content\". Meanwhile the Eververse (real money store) is constantly flooded with new items.Next up, constant server issues. Say what you want about Activision-Blizzard, they know how to handle traffic. For whatever reason, pretty much every play session now that were on Steam involves getting punted off entirely, or semi-constant \"we have lost connection to Steam servers, please log out and back in again\" issues.As for content, its generally just lackluster. The basic gameplay is fun, because Halo was fun. And Destiny is just \"Halo: the Looter-Shooter\", so its hard to mess up the bones, but the meat is pretty poor. Forsaken was good, but everything else has been short, underwhelming, and overly-expensive, and I dont honestly see that changing.Its F2P now so you cant really go wrong. Just dont believe any promises or hype Bungie puts out, and dont buy anything unless you can get it on sale. Wait a few weeks, see how whatever theyre selling pans out, then decide to buy or pass.", "Author": "OperaWolf", "Hours": 221.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 22, 2019", "Review": " Overview Destiny 2 is a semi-free looter shooter mmo rpg, that I heavily recommend. Below I will be listing the qualities of this game that I believe are executed extremely well and some of the issues I think this game has that are repairable. Content wise, this game is no where near lacking. While delivering a very simple play style, every new dlc expands and every planet has different scenery. You never run out of things to do, unless you no-life (literally) and trailers/gameplay give you a complete idea of what the game is like. I wont really be complaining about mechanics or anything the game already has implemented feature wise, because its either a core part of the game or not worth complaining about. Basically, if you like shooting things and collecting better items to improve in every aspect of the game so you can be the best. This is the game for you. The rest of the review is basically knit-picking. Pros  Introduction: I think Destiny 2 has a lot to offer. As listed above weve got, thousands of hours of content that is constantly being expanded upon, never ending list of improvements you can make to your character, nice system split between rng and things the player can control/do. Scenery is nice, gameplay feels like a Destiny/Bungie game and the game runs pretty well on most devices even with slightly outdated graphics cards.  Graphics And Scenery: Every planet looks beautiful, the background design is just so pleasant to the eye. This is outer-space looking its finest. For such a big game, the graphics are oh so spicy. Nice design between the different species and the way that certain attacks flow from taken to hive, they each have their own vibe area and lore. Everything in this department just hit the spot for me. You could be on the lowest possible graphics and have your game maybe look like doom, but its still beautiful. Its worthy of being my screensaver or background and thats saying something. I just love every single part of this aspect in the game and it adds so much to the gameplay. General Gameplay And Mass Amount Of Content: There is a mass amount of content in destiny currently. A lot of which is leaving with beyond light (Darkness lore and what not...), but still a lot of new additions and a fresh breath for returning players and D1 ogs looking for some nostalgia. The same Destiny formula from D1 is used but the hud is improved upon, new sub-classes and what not. Except, we still have mountains of new and old dlc content staying and leaving (I.e Raids n planets) so cheers Bungo! The Community: Destiny 2s community is one of the most important parts of the game. You can come into a game with an entire group of friends and create a clan, basically community building. Or you can join a community and meet some real great people that will stick with you and guide you through anything in the game. For players who want a challenge, you got clans for those. For players looking to complete team activities, you got clans for those. For players looking for free loot, you got clans for those too. And theres always the trusty discord and companion app LFG. Youre never out of options and more often than not youll meet somebody extremely nice. So props to all of us D2 players. Cons  Introduction: After finally deciding to re-review the game. After hours of play from battle.net to steam, I can firmly say this game is a pile of dog-sh*t sometimes. A pile of dog-sh*t, thats hard not to love. Though dog-sh*t may be an exaggeration, it can be extremely frustrating at times. The lack of challenge in the main components of the game (not getting flawless in dungeons) and how tedious a lot of these components are, bring up my main issue with the game. The community is very demanding at times, but it peaks often and the good outweighs the bad. And most of the issues I have with the game are knit-picking, sorry if I miss some things. Bungos Negligence Towards Their Own Mistakes: Since the game has moved to steam, every big event, switch-over, new dlc, has broken the servers and caused outrage within the community. Generally, youd get some error codes, contacting Bungo servers and random disconnection at peaks server highs on new releases. I  disagree  with the harassment they receive and some of the other backlash. Thing is, youd think theyd learn after the first time. The most  major  outage of them all shouldve been a big wake up call. Except, they decided to celebrate and ignore. I honestly hope with the release of Beyond Light this issue is fixed, but even the  small  event messed up their servers so I wouldnt count on it. The Payed Content Cross-Over IssuesThere isnt a personal issue here, but being semi-pay-to-play and largely free isnt really a sort of yin and yang. It causes a divide in the community, a  massive  pvp cheating issue (which will get its own section) and basically cancels out its own perks. While developing such a huge game, you need some form of income. I dont think many people care about cosmetics in Destiny 2, so dlcs are an important source of income. Issue is, when you make a huge chunk of the game free you may increase the player base, but you also cause a divide among the two sides. Paying players and New light players. Some want the game to be fully free because they dont have the money to blow and feel like its not worth it because theyll be overpowered in everything forever. The payed players are mad the content they payed for is becoming free and they have to pay more for the new stuff that gets locked out by server overflow caused by \"New light players.\" Some just wanna play the game, but this is still a little frustrating because both sides are losing out. This could be solved with cosmetics being more useful or rare, simply attempting to add incentive to them so everybody can play in harmony and unity. With the money already spent it could be an issue, but thats what an AA Company possibly AAA after new light have employees for. SOLVING ISSUES and CREATING. I would expand more on this, but I could go on forever so Ill stop it here. The point is pretty understandable though. Increase In Cheating As A Result Of New Light Dont even get me started on trials. CRACKDOWN on these dudes HARDER. Its that simple, Id much prefer you perfect the issues you have than replace them. This is a huge one, everybody likes a fair game especially in PVP. I hope this gets fixed sometime soon, but again wouldnt get my hopes up. New Light Issues In General... They come in all shapes and sizes. Why did sudden issues start popping up when we switched to steam? Well I cant tell you, but its been a good year and its time to fix them. Theyre annoying and constant, so yeah. Dont think theres much to expand on here. Justice For Useless Nerfs And Sunsetting Do it right Bungo... Final Thoughts All in all, this game is pretty addicting like most rpgs. It has improved since its move to steam in many ways, whilst still having issues that have yet to be fixed since launch. Game can be tedious and boring during some quest lines and give you one-time visits to special planets during others. It runs beautifully, it looks beautiful, the community is nice and the game is enjoyable and playable for almost anybody. Whether its on console, streaming services or normal pc play, you can get a hell of an experience. You can meet a lot of cool people in the lfg doing raids and/or just roaming. Id say its a great experience overall especially with friends and even if you dont have friends, find a clan, you might get a full fireteam. I heavily recommend this game and the memories Ive made in it, make it one of my all time favourites. Excuse the less fleshed out review and lackluster phrasing.

TL;DR this game is thoroughly unenjoyable unless you only play a few times a month, and you play it with a GROUP of friends. At least five other people ideally. If you dont have that, literally keep scrolling, this game is trash.This otherwise great game is plagued by its frankly insulting level of grind that never pays off in any way that feels worth it.There are so many minor tweaks that could improve the playability and enjoyability of this game, but theyre too focused on their premium store and making sure players are coming back every season, every week or every day even. It borders on disgusting at this point.For every good thing they do, theres something they royally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up. Theres aim assist, which is actually a good thing, it levels the playing field somewhat, you dont have to be insanely accurate in order to compete at the lowest rank (since matchmaking will always be \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up) so it becomes more of a game of knowledge and positioning.But they balance PVP and PVE together, which is just... SO stupid. There are many things in the game that you technically \"can play around\" but theyre just so annoying and absurd, especially in the right hands, that it can make the game feel LITERALLY unplayable. They hype this game up as you get to feel powerful or whatever. Some games you walk away feeling like complete garbage. Its not a good feeling, and youre basically forced into PVP if you want to do bounties or quests (which is literally the point of the game) So you get matches where you are also matched with people who are forced into the PVP, fighting against others who play PVP for fun, and theyre all in a group. Its \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 insane, this game is legitimately garbage in so many aspects.Quest/bounty progress, which is the point of the game, isnt shared usually, so youll go into a co-op mode fighting other people to get kills since only last hits count. Its ridiculous. It is absurd, plain and simple.There are some secrets in the game which make it feel mysterious and adds a bit of fun to it, honestly, there are some moments that are pretty great (the story is pretty bad, even forsaken which is better than red war is very mediocre. And shadowkeep? Is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 joke. Its literally like 4 missions. Thats it. Dont waste your time or money) but as usual, with every good idea they have, they have to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 things up somehow. So many of the secrets in the game are LITERALLY impossible for you to figure out unless youre a genius and have weeks to waste trying to decode \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. So for many \"secrets\" you just look up a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 guide.And some of the best \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is found through secret quests. OR insultingly grindy ones. The two Im thinking of are Whisper of the Worm and Izanagis Burden respectively.Raids are a good/interesting part of the game, but have the same problems as secrets. Either you struggle through trial and error, or you just look up a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 guide. So fun. And if you dont have 5 others to go through it with your first times, youll have to find a group. There is no matchmaking for raids. And youll either get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 on for not knowing how the encounters go, OR the raid will probably take an hour OR MORE because either teaching someone new or people keep messing up. It is NOT a good time, at all. If you have an actual real clan and/or friends, this would probably not even be an issue, but you wont. So it is. A very big issue.The fanbase is similar to Warframe, they seem to be absolutely complacent and way too forgiving of the developer, so, dont expect anything to change any time soon.", "Author": "HeadHunter", "Hours": 655.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 20, 2019", "Review": "Very Good game and full of fun fill activities especially if u hav friends.

Bottom line. And yes, after 400+ hours (including my unknown PS4 time), along with the big [Sept]November update coming, I suggest not playing this game.Why?:1.) Its not a game. Its a job with no paycheck. You work on the \"grind\" for hours for power-levels that are just content gates, and weapons and armor that wont be usable in half a year (sun-setting). 2.) Its a job you will love to hate. Youll find that with each time you log in, you lose more and more of yourself and your time to anger. Then youll have a hard time saying bad things because you sunk tons of time into it and want friends to play it with you.3.) Its both the easiest job and the most infuriating. Guns have bullet magnetism which means you dont have to aim and it ruins your muscle memory for any other FPS. PVP will, at this rate, never be balanced and swivels every season. Exotic weapons and armor that dominate Crucible (pvp) take many months to patch if too strong, and could destroy entire weapon archetypes or armor pieces. You could do hundreds of Nightfalls and never get the drops you want. 4.) I dont want to let people burden themselves with a game that they will probably will lose interest in if they dont have friends who play it. The best fun in this game is playing with people you know. But if youre a solo player (like I am after my switch to PC) you may find that the game is lacking in your field.5.) They killed off their only good NPC and havent replaced him. R.I.P.

Forsaken is where the game stands out a little more, the story is interesting and the bosses (if youre not over-levelled like I was) are actually challenging yet enjoyable to fight. Forsaken adds a lot more than just story however, with new raids, a new dungeon, a handful of new strikes, players have enough content to keep them happy for days of playtime.Shadowkeep, personally, is also a fantastic DLC. Whether its worth the price is ultimately up to you but from experience, the story is comparable to Forsakens. While a little short, it provides a lot of not only play but lore too.

My only complaints come from eververse and how expensive stuff is there even for people who own the current season.  Theyve acknowledged a request to perhaps give season pass owners 50% off silver purchases, and that is a start, but bright dust economy needs a serious overhaul, and I say that as a dedicated player who has played through every iteration of that economy.  Start of year 2 was probably the best.  Right now its some of the worst.As for the game itself:In terms of content, seasons offer a lot to do, and the newest raid is excellent, as many have been.If youve never played a looter shooter, this is a great one to pick up and play, although if youre just trying the free version, it kind of just dumps you into it.  If you have a friend to play with, thats where this is at its best, but there is a lot of content for solo players, even if you have to look up where to do things like campaigns, which are now sort of relegated to an NPC.If you were ever interested in getting pinnacle crucible weapons like Recluse and Mountaintop, now is the time to do it.  Its never been more achievable since Glory rank now heavily matches you based on skill and not just Glory number, although thats involved in the process a bit it appears.  Give it a shot.  Im very average and Im thinking I can actually hit top rank this time.  Absolutely get Forsaken too.  Its campaign is so much better than the others its not even funny.  Legitimately a good fps campaign on its own too, although I would recommend quickly playing through the others first.Shadowkeeps campaign is short but very interesting if you are familiar with the story.  If you arent, youll probably not understand why what is shown is such a big deal.  Absolutely dont do shadowkeep stuff first.Ive got like 2000+ hours in this game over the past couple years, and unfortunately I have to say about 1000 of that was in the first year when it took a good 9 months before the game really started getting good.  Idk I have a problem.  Legitimately regret it.  I had just come off of Destiny 1 which ended in a great spot and kept seeing glimpses of how this could be like that.  Year 2 on the other hand I havent regretted at all and had a blast.  And now in year 3, as it is, its awesome too.  Raids are awesome especially if you can find a good crew.

I played through the worst of times with the franchise and have stuck with it to see it become what it is today. Extremely fun, with friends or even solo. I really enjoy looking for that perfect weapon roll even if the activity gets a bit repetitive, I know the reward will be worth it! (Im lookin at you Snapshot/Quickdraw Mindbenders) PvE End Game The Power Level grind has been pretty much crushed with these later expansions but Shadowkeep keeps it interesting with Master Difficulty. Players can power up to about 940-950 with ease thanks to the artifact, but 950 Base Power is where it really hits a wall. In any other expansion or DLC going above the recommended power for the raid (940 in Shadowkeep) would be an utter waste of time. But as I said, weve got Master Mode activities now!With the latest expansion Bungie has given us Master Difficulty (980 Power) for Nightfalls and the new Nightmare Hunts. Both activities on Master are a good challenge that is sorely needed for the title.Master Nightmare Hunts are a good bit easier than Master Nightfalls and dont offer nearly as good of rewards excluding a single Pinnacle (951+) drop each week.Master Nightfalls are where you will really want to spend your time as an end game player. Here you will find materials for masterworking your armor and a great drop-rate for Exotic items. Everything Else If participating in the slow end game grind for minuscule power advancement isnt your bread and butter than youll be please to know that there are a plethora of quests to do. Im not even joking. I have 100+ hours since the Steam release and many, many more on my console and my quest log is still 3 damn pages. You will find things to do.With that in mind though Bungie should really make it clearer for new players on where to start. Before Shadowkeep it would start you at the beginning. Level 1 with 10 Power. Now you start at Level 50 with 750 Power and can jump into the last 2 years worth of content right away and that can be a bit overwhelming.I should also mention that Destiny 2 has 5 main stories/campaigns in the game. The Red War, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken & Shadowkeep. Red War and Forsaken are very good and enjoyable , the best of the 5, while Shadowkeep isnt nearly as impressive for a newcomer. Unless youre really soaking in all the dialogue the importance of Shadowkeep may be lost on you. Warmind takes that sweet 4th place, mainly because I didnt want to end it all while playing through it and the weapons that came from it are really good. That leaves Curse of Osiris. I think you should play this once. Only once. Only come back to Mercury when you want to gather Prophecy Weapons or finish up more story bits. I dont even recommend doing the weekly Flashpoint onthis planet unless you really need to gear or want to do some Triumphs for score. I dislike Curse of Osiris very much, it is borderline awful. Some of the quests, Paradox/Saint-14, help it.Now despite that last bit there...Overall I can say that Destiny is an experience worth buying into. What used to be a hefty $100+ buy-in is now around the standard $60 for newcomers. Its well worth that price. I didnt really dive into PvP and Gambit here but I do recommend them. Crucible can be awful if youre brand new but Skill Based Matchmaking should save you!See you on the battlefield, Guardian.", "Author": "Shipman", "Hours": 285.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 31, 2019", "Review": "How to explain...

Most content is either solo or designed to pair you with 2 other players automatically but works well as a 2 or 3 person co-op. Raids (6 ppl) and PVP (1 to 6 ppl) are fairly optional beyond the occasional need to satisfy completionist tendencies. The story is meh, the graphics are fine, but the real stars in this game are the basics of running around and shooting at things along with the the pursuit of weapons that are fun to shoot with (not nessisarily better, just different).The gunplay is just amazing. A bunch of futuristic and interesting weapons along with freeing mobility (you get basically a triple jump mechanic or equivalently mobile jetpack skills) combine with enemies that have quirks and weakpoints yet are still fairly predictable. Destiny doesnt like to surprise the player and thats a really good thing. Enemies tend to spawn in front of you, not behind. Bosses telegraph their big attacks several seconds in advance. Mechanics and jumping can be challenging but the player stays in control of their experience. Most of the game you can tuck behind a wall and stand still, ignored by the world forever.The variety of weaponry in destiny is pretty amazing and most of it is pretty well balanced. Loadouts have tradeoffs, ranges vary, ammo consumption and ammo type prevent you from hoarding only the biggest thing you can get your hands on, etc. Most of the gameplay revolves around grinding for the new hot gun and the feeling of accomplishment when you get it.Destinys main flaws are that it may force you into game types you dont like (raids, PVP, competitive PVE, jumping puzzles, or super grindy PVE) and fails to provide multiple ways to the same reward. It also loves to be obtuse and make you use the internet to find things. If you want to discover where something is yourself it can take an obscene amount of time wasted but google will tell you how to do it in 30 seconds. The game is designed for streamers to show off day 1 content releases and they are drip fed basically weekly though larger bundles hit once every 3 months.

The Bad This game is NOT free. What the game offers as \"free\" is basically an indefinite demo / trial of the game. You only get access to the three main playlists (Vanguard Strikes, Crucible (PvP) and Gambit (PvPvE), there is no campaign or story to play outside of the intro missions for the paid campaigns. You get access to one dungeon (Prophecy) and one raid (Vault of Glass), which you wont be able to play for a very long time because grinding to that power level takes VERY long as a free player. The new player experience is AWFUL. Once you completed the New Light quest line in the Cosmodrome (which only takes maybe an hour), youre thrown into the middle of the game, you get bombarded with quests left and right and youre basically told \"go do whatever you wanna do\" without anybody even really telling you what you can do. Playing this game without having an experienced player show you the ropes and help you get through what to do is near impossible. FOMO (fear of missing out). Yeah, no Destiny review is complete without mentioning the dreading FOMO in this game. Seasonal content is currently basically on a yearly timer, whenever the next expansion releases, all seasonal content leaves the game. In addition to this, current content in the game can rotate into the so called \"Destiny Content Vault\" at any given time, which is just a fancy way for Bungie to say theyre removing content from the game, even content you paid for. As of today, 4 destinations were removed, 5 raids, countless playlist activities and quests, 3 campaigns and lots more. Time investment. In order to even get started in this game, you need to bring a lot of time and dedication to get through everything there is to do. A lot of things take A LONG time to get (materials for exotics etc.).So why do I still recommend this game after all these things? Well, lets come to the good things about the game. The Good The game itself. Destiny has a phenomenal sandbox unlike any other game youve ever played. The characters feel great, gunplay is unmatched, the guns are unique. Basically anything you as a player can do in the game feels excellent. Bungie constantly changes things up in the sandbox which keeps things fresh for everybody. The story. Bungie built an insane fantasy world with an extremely deep-going and far-reaching story, with multiple story lines, interesting characters. The seasonal model this year basically has been a constant expansion and conclusion of these things, and many Destiny players will tell you that were currently going through the Destiny peak of storytelling. The content we have and get. Raids in this game are unlike any other game youve ever played, communication is vital, everybody has a role to fulfill and the actual raids themselves deliver amazing experiences. Theres a lot of endgame content and loot to chase, and all of it useful in their own way. Theres tons of challenging content, and a lot of it can even be completed solo, like dungeons. I have over 2500 hours in this game. Yeah, Im not gonna be one of those people who has thousands of hours in a game and then proceeds to not recommend the game. I play this game religiously, and barely miss out on any content there is. Once you get into the flow of the game, it feels really good.

Importantly, the content Destiny 2 had built up since its launch remained in-tact and playable, meaning that previous raids, activies, triumphs etc. were all accessible and able to be furthered.As a dedicated player of Destiny, by which I mean that I regularly spent 10 hour days playing Destiny at certain points, the range of activities, while potentially meaningless to many players, including the massive range and depth of the Triumph (effectively achievement) system and solo-ing the 7 raids and 3 dungeons, presented a large variety of options for playing Destiny. This is what kept the game entertaining and playable for me, as the range of content was not so strictly limited and the variety of newer and older content was perfect.What I therefore do not fully understand was the removal of the majority of this content. Bungie didnt decide to trim the fat and cut away at the edges to remove tired content, they removed most of the content in their game.I have heard the rationale behind this decision, that the file-sizes were becoming too large and that room needed to be made for new content, but seeing the result in November of 2020, I believe the game is in a worse position that it was two years ago.Im now going try to draw up a list of content that Bungie decided to remove from Destiny 2 and what they replaced this content with, as I think this helpfully demonstrates how insane this really is - feel free to read it through if you feel it necessary, but I understand if this is simply too much content to read through: Removed 5 out of 8 6 man raids from the game, which I consider to be THE most important PvE content for end-game players Removed the destinations Mars, Mercury, Titan and IO; for reference this constitutes the removal of half of the games launch destinations in addition both the destinations introduced throughout the entirety of Year 1. I guess they also technically removed the farm but that place was useless anyway. Removed the associated strikes from all of these destinations, which comprise a very large portion of the repeatable PvE content in their re-using as nightfalls, grandmaster nightfalls etc. These strikes include Savathuns Song and Festering Core which I considered to be some of my favourites. Sunsetted, effectively made useless through power-capping, large swathes of the weapon pool including all Last Wish and Shadowkeep weapons Removed seasonal content including: The Reckoning and thereby all of its associated armour and weaponry, the entire Black Armory expansion and all forges, secret missions The Whisper and Zero Hour, the entire Leviathan and all of the content surrounding it, including the Menagerie (a VERY well liked 6 man matchmade activity) and associated rewards, the Tribute Hall In addition to the above, removed the gamemode Gambit Prime and all associated triumphs with all relevant armour pieces sunsetted, removed 7 crucible PvP modes Removed 11 crucible maps, equating to approximately 1/3 of the crucible maps in the game in late 2020 in addition to removing two gambit maps of the six that were originally present, again equating to 1/3. Removed the entire Destiny 2 launch campaign (named The Red War) in addition to all story content associated with the Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLCs, effectively purging the entire launch and first year of Destiny 2s story content. Alongside this all of the story and mission content from Season of the Forge, Drifter and Opulence were removed, effectively wiping all of the content from the second year also. Removed the missions and quests to acquire at least 15 exotic weapons, which are now simply purchasable from a vendor in the tower with a currency; kind of loses its charm and appeal... To name a few, the random drops for raid weapons such as Anarchy and Terrabah were removed, along with the missions for the Whisper of the Worm, Bad Juju, Worldline Zero sword (which they already nerfed into the ground anyway), Ace of Spades, Legend of Acrius, Last Word and many, MANY more. Effectively removed the triumph system from the game alongside its accompanying seals (i.e. titles) system that comprised a large part of the grind for end-game players, making over half of the seals unobtainable for players who did not yet acquire them. The revamping of the triumph system effectively wipes all previous triumph score to be replaced with a FAR more limited set of new triumphs that do not present anywhere close to the same depth. I think that it is also worth mentioning that seasonal content introduced from the launch of Shadowkeep onwards is wiped at the end of each season, meaning that new content introduced to the game only remains for a single season and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.TL;DR for the removed content: 5 of 8 raids, 11 crucible PvP maps, 2 gambit maps, 4 entire destinations, effectively all year 1 and 2 content (excluding the Forsaken expansion itself), vast numbers of missions, over half the games seals and a massive reduction to the games triumph (achievement) system and sun-setted (power-capped, effectively rendering useless in new content) hundreds of weapons from any content over a year old.Thats a lot of stuff, and I really hope its not just me that sees this as absolutely insane.What did they replace it with? In short, positive features such as an entirely new set of subclasses for each character were added, an entirely new and quite large destination in Europa, the Deep Stone Crypt raid which has been largely well received, a reintroduction of harder-difficulty lost sectors with exotic rewards, the return of the Cosmodrome destination from Destiny 1, the addition of two new strikes, funnily enough 0, yes, 0 new PvP maps, Empire Hunts (essentially Shadowkeep 1.5), the Beyond Light story content and quests and the seasonal activity which will be replaced at the end of this season alongside some new exotic quests and a secret Hawkmoon mission.Theres definitely some good content here, with the raid being of good quality and with good weapons and armour drops, the Europa destination is great and the addition of new subclasses is refreshing. But how long does this content really last? I would contend between two and four weeks for hardcore players seeking to complete everything as quickly as possible.Now, usually I would be able to accept this, and if all of the previous content had remained, this would have been an excellent expansion which Im sure I would be praising right now. What matters most to me, is that CLEARLY AND BEYOND ANY DOUBT the new content is not even close to sufficient to even begin to replace the sheer quantity of content that has been removed. I genuinely believe that Destiny 2 was a far, far better, replayable and content-rich game prior to the launch of Beyond Light in November of 2020.I truly loved playing this game every day, however I fundamentally cant accept this strategy from Bungie in the development of this game, entirely regardless of the reasons behind their decision to remove this content. Im disappointed, underwhelmed and am really missing the 70% of the game Bungie decided to wipe with this expansion.

So as you can tell, Im basically just getting my first character levelled. Let me start with what I like most about Destiny; the Lore. When the first Destiny game came out, people said it had no story, and they were right, at launch it was pretty weak. The expansions for that game helped, but not *really* until The Taken King did that get much better. It dipped again during Rise Of Iron and again with Destiny 2 at launch, and just sort of puttered along until Forsaken came out. Im only talking about the story presented directly to you, though. One part of the franchise that has never been weak has been the lore. If you were willing to read the Grimoire online in D1 and go through the lore individually in D2 (before they added it properly) and finally, go through full groupings of the lore in the D2 lore collections....you would be in for a very deep, rich story thats seemingly full of everything. Most people were not and are not, though. Suffice to say, there is a universe of awesome in there if you take the time to read it. If youre interested in the lore, but dont want to parse it, there are a few great channels out there, but I recommend MyNameIsByf on youtube. He has a recent 4 hour video on the entire history of Destiny up to this point (both in-game and in-lore). Basically if you commit to the game and understanding the world(s) in which in takes place, you will be rewarded, but dont expect to play through the campaign and understand fully what the hell is going on. You will have an idea, but it wont be fully realised. The next thing I like is movement. Each of the classes has their own jumps, so they all feel unique; for example its very unique to watch a warlock miss a ledge and slowly float down to their death, while the hunter will always tell you how they hate that stupid bug that triggers their second jump initially, as they speedily fall to their death. Meanwhile titans are on the other side of the map headbutting things and shoulder charging off a ledge to their deaths. Anyways, the movement is snappy and fast, but not as snappy or fast as something like Warframe. It feels good because it strikes a balance of between how other games feel, with it leaning on the side of snappy and fast. Guns, glorious guns. In D1, guns were good. In D2, guns were worse because they changed to fixed rolls for them. Then they fixed that, and guns were glorious. Then they nerfed the best ones, so people had to find the new meta. This happens every season. I wish they would buff other things instead of nerfing individual things, but there is always something overpowered to use if youre chasing that power fantasy. The guns feel amazing, the sound design for them is great, they all feel weighty and like they have impact. Unique intrinsic perks available only on specific weapons can completely change your playstyle, which is great for keeping the game fresh. My only complaint with guns is like I said, I wish they would buff everything instead of nerfing one thing. When something feels good, you get caught up in using just that gun which sucks when they are tons of other fun things to use (they just might not do *quite* as much DPS).Music and sound are top notch. I dont need to say much about this, they are as polished as you can hope for in anything.UI/UX wasnt always good, and its still not perfect, but they have made a lot of great changes in Shadowkeep and Im pretty happy with where its at now.Content/progression. Its easy for me to tell you what to do in the game and in what order, but Bungie decided a lot of things no longer really matter from a rewards perspective (regular loot vs. powerful loot which increases your power level). The Red War, Curse Of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken and all the seasonal activities like Escalation Protocol, Blind Well, Menagerie, etc. are there for anyone to do at any time, but the rewards they give will not match up to the new content, so Bungie is clearly steering people towards the new stuff. Thats fine, but there is some really great stuff in all those activities that people would be missing out on if they only focus on chasing power. Play at your own pace. Also, they removed the visibility of those campaigns and activities as well, pushing them all onto Amanda in the hangar at the tower. Thats weird. Visuals/performance are pretty darn awesome. I rarely have issues, and when I do they are related to network/server issues and not things on my end. Ultrawide avg 80fps with 150% scaling and 105 deg fov is about all i could ask for in a game, and the fact that it looks beautiful while doing that without having any real hiccups is awesome. The mod system was reasonably solid early on in Destiny 2, but now it feels a lot more fleshed out. My only complaint with it right now is the same complaint that most people have: elemental affinity needs to go. Its not a game breaker, its just adding a bit too much of a layer of grind onto the game when looking for god-rolled gear.Speaking of gear, I love the way some (not all) of the exotics change your playstyle up. I main Hunter, so my experience is mostly there. Want to punch everything? Liars Handshake will help you one punch ogres. Want to annihilate bosses with one shot? Celestial Nighthawk will convert your golden gun shots into one single blast. Grenades all day? Lucky Raspberrys got ya. And on and on. The game definitely has \"builds\", though maybe not as complex as in other games. Gear optimisation, getting good rolls on random perks, min/maxing stats. I enjoy all of that. Some people will not, and for them, the static rolls of early D2 were probably a lot more fun. But I love it. If you enjoy min/maxing you will enjoy the gear in this game.The long and the short of it is: do you like to pew pew? oh you do? why not try destiny 2?", "Author": "aeon", "Hours": 1671.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 15, 2019", "Review": "activision-blizzard bad, steam good", "Author": "Rat-keteer", "Hours": 62.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 14, 2019", "Review": "One of the best online multiplayer games you can play at the moment.

F2P players are definitely second class citizens but they do have access to a large portion of the game and really just there to help fill out the community which I have found to be a bit lacking. I say that F2P is second class citizens and call it a demo because there are still things locked behind a paywall. The 3 classes each have 3 skill trees but one of those skill trees is locked behind a paywall so P2P will have build options that F2P doesnt. The 2 skill trees F2P have access to are almost exactly the same too and the locked tree acts significantly differently, opening different strategies and play styles. P2P also have access to weapons that F2P dont so it is a bit P2W. The damage normalization in PvP is interesting but some of the weapons that P2P players have access to have unique modifiers  which cant me normalized and the access to pay only skills can be considered a bit P2W. There are also raids that are locked behind a paywall. At a glance this doesnt seem like a huge deal but when the weekly Nightfall rotation falls on a P2P raid and F2P cant play it for a whole week, thats a bit off putting and slows your progress compared to P2P players because theres always 2 weekly Prime Engram quests on Nightfall and these are the only ways to level up once you reach the softcap. So thats 2 of 8 weekly Prime Engram quests I think? But if youre in it for the looting and shooting PvE and dont care much for PvP then its not a huge handicap. If you only play and hour or two a day, youll have plenty of stuff to do just from dailies.I have found the community a bit lacking though but I havent actively tried to join any clans. At 4:00pm PST on a Saturday afternoon Ive had to wait 10 minutes to get a Crucible Control game going. Its not uncommon to have to wait 10 minutes for a Reckoning group either or to drop in as a fill with only 1 minute left and no hope of winning so you have to hope that everyone is up for another run or go back to the queue. Communication with other players is severely lacking with the global chat hidden most of the time. On the bright side, you dont get bots spamming world chat like in other F2P games. If you tried Destiny 2 F2P when it was on B.net and enjoyed it for 2 hours before you hit that painfully low and obvious paywall, give the new F2P a try. I think youll like it. Worst case you waste your time with the 80GB d/l. Its great to scratch that, \"I just wanna run around and shoot some stuff\" itch.

The visual/audio feedback is outstanding, the handling feels really good on most weapons, and enemies really pop when you take them out. I expected nothing less from the studio that gave us the Halo franchise.The game is better played with friends or with a team. Now that the base game and all of Year 1 content with some sprinkled Year 2 content (with a lot of content behind it and I mean ALOT), this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo or with 1 person. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there).With that said, the dungeons which are currently only The Shattered Throne and the new one, unknown as of this review, for Shadowkeep and raids Leviathan and its shorter Raid Lairs which are available to All Free to Play people. Scourge of the Past, Crown of Sorrows, Last Wish which are all Year 2 content and need to buy Forsaken and the Annual Pass to have access to and Garden of Salvation, the newest of the raids currently available which is in Shadowkeep are best done with a team, so dont afraid to use LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to tell the people your experience, level, and gear.)Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I really enjoy Gambit, its a PvPvE game mode that adds a twist to the classic PvP play most of us are used to. Get into the occasional Strike which are PvE, matchmade teams of 3 running campaign-like missions, and have a okay amount of interest Crucible which is the traditional PvP game mode, its fine if you wanna say that, but Ive never liked PvP too much because all it was, was teamshotting and shotguns.Dont be afraid to ignore content (god knows I have) - this is very much the kind of game where you can do what you want. Want a specific exotic? Research where it drops and  grind that specific content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best farming method and go grind to your hearts content. Do some of the exotic quests that the game literally bombards you with, or just screw around doing things that you find entertaining while absolutely ignoring everything else.Some stuff just isnt explained well or at all  in game. Its not as bad as Warframe (Got close to 4000 hours on that game) but some things are still hidden. Feel free to look up the exotic vendor Xur who visits on the weekends. Whisper of the Worm, Zero Hour, and Bad Juju are just a few of the more hidden ane cool content out there.For anything that you cant easily find online (mostly everything can be found online)  reach out and find a sherpa, you can find them in the official LFG Discord! The community for this game is pretty amazing, and alot of us have spent enough time learning specific parts of it for example the raids, or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") wed be happy to jump onto discord and answer any and all questions you may have.Now is the best time to be getting into Destiny 2 and New Light! You will look at the hours you put into the game and be surprised at how fast it felt it went. Take all of the pettiness and negative reviews about the game going Free to Play, servers crashing for less than an hour after launch (really not hard to know that was gonna happen with new DLC launch AND opening up the game to everyone), or whatever else has triggered people with a massive grain of salt. The fact that a massive chunk of this game is now free makes this the perfect time to try the game out without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere. Not on the reviews of the game as everyone else has different views.If youre looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro mission in the Cosmodrome, load into the Tower (social area), turn left from the spawn and make your way to the Hangar (check your map with Tab if you get lost) and talk to Amanda Holiday in the Tower and check out her Legacy Content offerings. Release order was The Red War > Curse of Osiris > Warmind, but you can probably skip Curse of Osiris if you want (the story started to get better during warmind, but still reccomend playing CoO as it gives some back story on certain characters.). Remember, everyone is starting at the max light level from the Forsaken expansion, which is great for playing with veterans without too much grinding, but means that you miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the story campaigns.TLDR; Game has alot going for it, amazing music.

Dont get me wrong, its nothing excellent but its good enough to be a challenge for you and to be fun. (Still better than dead AI from Borderlands 1,2 or Payday 2 and i mention these games because I find them very bad and good example how enemy AI should not look  but that is again my opinion of course)WEAPONSThere are plenty of guns to use and you will mostly use legendary gear the other rarities are more of an introduction what to expect and you will use them only for few moments in the beginning because its not hard to get hands-on some legendary stuff.Some of the weapons are very unique and offers quite good and satisfying gunplay but dont expect every gun to be crazy like from borderlands.There are such weapons but they are called exotic and its the best gear you can get. Exotic weapons or even an exotic armours offers unique ability which can have an advantage in PVP or PVE but since they are powerful you can have equipped only one exotic weapon and one exotic piece of armour at the same time.Tbh you will find yourself with a nice collection of some of your most favourite \"babies\" in no time and grinding them is simply great fun.I personally like hand canons in this game, they are really fun to play and you will get in your hands some cool futuristic or old fashioned good looking pieces.Now Messy stuffStory is good and interesting and worth digging in, but...If youre new to the game you will get a very short introduction without exactly saying whats going on in the story and the whole world youre in.Its like getting in mid of the game for some reason where all the characters know you but you dont know them and you dont know what the hell are they talking about because you have never been properly introduced to the plot.You can pick it up in the tower and play the campaign that is surely very fun but not as rewarding like in past but few quests will make it up for you.You have access to some activities which were unlocked after completing the main story but now you are free to try them right away but again, you got no clue why you are doing this mission, what is its purpose and who is that boss in the end and who are those people talking at you through the whole thing.Its messy and it could have been done better but Its still a very good game and I dont think that this bad introduction is a reason to give it a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in reviews that is just a crybaby move and complete ignorance to all the good stuff and I believe it will be set in more proper way in the future because like this you have only few reasons to buy Forsaken or Shadowkeep since you dont even know what the hell is going on.7.5/10", "Author": "STOFINGUN", "Hours": 390.7}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 8, 2019", "Review": "February 2022 Pre-Witch Queen update:**If you are an ex-Destiny player considering if it is worth returning** - You know what the game is about.

The grind is currently tedious with minimal effort from devs (the same grinding thats been in game for literally years), bad gameplay loops and forced re-grinding of the same weapons and armour due to sunsetting. The added FOMO and how far you can fall behind in terms of weapons, mods and limited time drops makes the game a timesink that over time feels tedious and like a second job. Some of this has been addressed, but overall still feels bad to come back to after long breaks. This doesnt remove from the fact that Destiny has some of the smoothest gameplay you will find, its beautiful and the gunplay is fabulous.

Having said that the content was hella juicy and made up for it. Anyways I finally moved on before the first DLC Curse of Osiris. Like I said great game not enough things to do especially for basically a mmo-fps.So time flies by as it is want to do, and a few months ago I get this itch to check out that killer game I played a while back and  see what the haps is. Also heard it was doing well on PC and I prefer PC over PS4 so yeah. WELL let me tell you from what I saw it was enough to convince me not to wait till the F2P/Steam move. I just went ahead and got the deluxe pack w/e it was called on Blizz...So I had everything up to Shadowkeep. Let me tell you I do not regret one penny spent, the past few months have reminded me why Bungie is such a great company. Even when shackled by Activision, D2 was kicking butt and taking names. What can I say, the PC graphics are stunning and outclass both the XBOXone and PS4....the amount of content at the moment is outstanding, even without Forsaken. However I 100% recommend you get Forsaken as it just spices things up, an amazing story campaign and MORE content. The gameplay itself is absolutely smooth, Its like Halo mixed with a bit of Borderlands, Skyrim,Warframe and mmo-rpg elements...need I say more lol. The grind is smooth and does not feel like a grind at all with all the activities both PvE(campaign,strikes,nightfalls,raids,jumping puzzle quests etc) and PvP(crucibles 6 modes, Gambits 4 different PvE 4v4 arena-ish/wave fighting games etc)...you wont run out of things to do. Especially with the immense Triumph section...basically your achievements but they can actually matter! Not to mention the billion quests(exotic ones as well OooOoo) and daily/weekly bounties...you will be busy :).All I have is praise for this game...its not what it was at release. And now that Bungie has complete freedom and teamed up with Steam I only expect things to get better. Keeping in mind I havent even mentioned Destiny 2: Shadowkeep. Which I also 120% recommend because it takes the game I was speaking of and just amplifies it and makes it shine even brighter with countless additions I wont even bother. Give this game a go, youd be doing yourself a disservice if you just skipped over it, I mean come on this isnt your average free to play game here this is BUNGIE...I can almost guarantee that if you hop on this game it will catch you hook line an sinker an youll be buying Shadowkeep lol. One last thing is that, yes if you want to be competitive you can be and if you want to be casual, or somewhere in between this game gives you the option, just need to find a clan! Which I highly recommend, while not necessary while Campaigning joining a clan gives the game a whole new feeling and a sense of community. Also it makes life easier to find groups and all that, just join a clan that fits your needs!Did I mention that lore geeks will fall in love with this beautifully crafted story...personally it might be one of my favorite stories in a game to date.

I bought a PS4 specifically for the game. It may have had a bumpy start, but Bungie stuck with it and improved it more and more. Then, unfortunately, Destiny 2 came out and also had a pretty bumpy start. Some people said it was at its worst point in the franchise with Curse of Osiris. But then once again, Bungie persevered and made the game better once again. Then they left their partnership with Activision and have now given us a wonderful year of steady content. Some of it might not have been the best, but Id say there was way more good then bad during the annual pass. And it was a whole year of steady content. Not a whole lot of games can pull that off. Now theyve given us Shadowkeep, one of the biggest things to happen to this franchise so far. At the time of this review, Shadowkeep has only been out for a day, but it already feels like some of the best stuff Bungie has ever made. So my whole point of this review is to let everyone know that you can trust Destiny now. Its past has been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I believe that Bungie is finally giving the community what weve always wanted. And now a good portion of the game is FREE. So you can try it out and if you dont like it, move on to something else. If you do like it, buy Shadowkeep and join this wonderful community of Guardians. Ive put a lot of time in to this franchise and its finally turning out to be the thing that Ive wanted for a while.

Also, the concept art behind it is just amazing. More than one time i stopped playing just to watch a bit of scenery, and it still amaze me.It looks a bit like starwars if a bit of fantasy was mixed in it, which i really like- Sound = Very good quality, nothing to say here. Also, the sound design of ennemies, and weapons you wield is also of very good quality (some weapons are really satisfying to hear, and you end up using them just because of it)- Story = Not bad, but not great either, atleast it exist, and it is very well paced making it a very good tutorial for players that do not know about Destinys lore. However, dont expect a lot of twists on it.- Gameplay = Pretty nice, i would say it is 80% FPS and 20% RPG, movements are a bit slow but it is still very dynamic.The bad :If i recommended this game that would mean,- That i agree seeing the game i paid for close to 100\u20ac becoming totally free one year after its launch- That i agree of microtransactions prices (12\u20ac for an emote, 8\u20ac for a weapon skin), which are horrendously expensive- That i agree bungies politic of deleting content (if you download this game right now, you will NEVER have access to weapons of Year 1, for instance)- That i think that the grinding behind it is interesting (yeah, lets kill another 500 robots to have this catalyst that will make my exotic weapon 5% better ! wouhou !)- That the social functions are sufficient (this game being classified as a MMOFPS) = Close to no clan tools, only 5 different channel you can use to discuss with other people (including 3 that are either instance based or based on your group)- That the dlc politic is fine (every year you will have to pay 60 bucks if you want all the content - and as a reminder, this game was originally not free)- That the game has close to zero glitch/exploit/bugs (Way too many to list, but for reference, some issues exist since last year and has never been resolved)- That the Ban policy is fine, just look into it on the web, for instance, you can be ban because you merely have a bad internet connection with absolutely no possibility to contact Bungiess support to defend yourselfAnd i think i only sratched the surface, i did not even talk about the cosmetic system, how some activities do not have matchmaking (and the game does not support any LFG function to recruit people), how old content is recycled, how you can be temporarily banned from competitive PvP due to a Destiny 2 error...

Theres just so much content and the developers are really invested in this game and its community. 11/10.EDIT 1: 300 HOURS. Crucible balancing updates: Bungies \"nerfs\" are really sub-par. They have failed to appropriately nerf OP exotics such as EOM. They successfully nerfed Recluse (after 9 months). PvP is not enjoyable as much as it could be. Though, Bungie recently have made some positive changes to competetive in the last couple of seasons, adding a solo-queue playlist, and increasing the amount of glory earned (though still fair), and making the streak system a little more forgiving. All which have been great improvements to COMP and encouraging more players to get involved. On the PvE side, The current seasonal activity, Sundial, is OK. But I definitely preferred season of Opulences Menagerie, which felt very rewarding and much more enjoyable.  The Saint-14 quests so far have been enjoyable, but I want to see more of these sort of quests and exploration into the games very expansive lore. Though, The raids in the game, especially Last Wish and Garden of Salvation, are really magnificent and massive open areas to explore and mechanics to learn. One of Bungies strong points IMO.And to end off, Bungie need to work more on quest steps and objectives in PvP and PvE. Some quest steps fell like like a lame excuse for \"content\", and feel like to-do list.

I sadly came to regret my purchase because of how tedious the game appeared to become after the main campaign ended. There just was not a lot of stuff to do or loot to collect.Fast-forward to the release of Forsaken. I didnt buy it, but I saw that a lot of free content was being released for players, including the Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLCs. After playing through both of those, and the rest of the free content Bungie has been supplying to cheap players like me, I can confidently say that there is finally enough to do in this game to keep me entertained for months possibly. There are still some tedious content in the game, but there is just enough uniqueness to the gameplay loop that has kept me hooked since Forsaken came out.Again, I havent bought that expansion yet, or Shadowkeep, at the time of me writing this review. I know I would now feel good about buying any of those two expansions in the future if it means keeping Destiny 2 alive for many more years to come.EDIT: I bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep. Forsaken is good with plenty of content and a ton more loot to grind for. Shadowkeep is just ok, and its kinda short. All the endgame-level activities for both expansions are a lot of fun tho.EDIT: Beyond Light is an alright expansion. Couple of new things to do like a new raid and a new subclass. However, the cost of this expansion means the rest of the content in the game seems buggy. The release of Beyond Light has brought a TON of bugs to Tower, Gambit, Crucible, and Strikes. Worst of all, the remaining 2 raids, Garden of Salvation and Last Wish, are buggy as hell. Last Wish in particular has the worst bugs, impacting final phases of the final boss encounter.

Playing solo, or with a friend -- Highly recommended, theres even a dedicated place on Bungies site to find a clan that interests you if you dont have anybody! -- are both really enjoyable ways to play.

Not only is it an incredible FPS with some of the best feeling gun play you can find in a modern game, it also has content for nearly every player. Like playing solo games? There is lots of activities that you are more than welcome to complete on your own such as quests, story-lines, bounties, patrols, and so much more. There is also a great number of matchmade activities that you can play whenever you want such as strikes (a mission with a big boss at the end that you get to just dump damage into), PvP where you can test your skills against other guardians, activities such as the menagerie and so much more. And then there are the raids. This is the thing that Destiny does differently than just about every other looter shooter. 6-man activities where you go into an area with little to no guidance as to how to kill the massive bosses infront of you and progress to your final goal. Not only do you have to do massive amounts of damage to these bosses, but the enemies also challenge you and there are some very complex raid mechanics that force you to change up the way you are fighting the boss or accomplish a goal before the boss just obliterates your entire team. In summary, I have been playing Destiny for 5 years now and to say I enjoy the game is an understatement. Yes, I complain about the game all the time, but thats only because I want to see it be the best it possibly can be, and over the last year its really feeling like we are approaching Destinys golden era.

Having said that, i found my time with it to be pretty damn enjoyable.PVP:Im gonna start with PVP first, since its where i spend most of my time on D2. Bungie with their years of Halo experience knows how to make a shooter that feels good, which adds to the appeal of the PVP side of the game. The PVP feels fair for the most part (with some exceptions) meaning you dont have to own any of the DLCs to do well in it. The weapons feel,, sound and look very good compared to shooters in general, not just looter type games. Thats not to say theyre easy to master, or easily accessible, but if i had to make a comparison, id say it feels pretty close to Halo in terms of the range of weapons and skill level youd need to do decently in the PVP.PVE:The PVE admittedly are a little bit grindy, but i assume that its on par with most other looter RPGs out there. That said, even if you arent a hardcore player, if you only hop on for a few hours per week, youre still guaranteed to get something out of it, whether it be finishing an exotic quest for a rare weapon, doing some PVE missions with strangers, or even finishing a Raid with your friends. With the Steam migration and a several year long support plan, Destiny 2 is worth a try more than ever, not to mention that its free, so hey, what can you lose.And i get it, \"Warframe is better, and its free\"; the WF comparisons are fair and warranted, but speaking as someone who prefer FPS to TPS, D2 scratches an itch for me that WF doesnt. Sure its not the \"Warframe Killer\", even tho its not trying to be, id say its a pretty good contender in the Looter-Shooter market. When i first installed D2, i half expected it to disappoint me so much that i had an excuse to uninstall and delete a ~80 gigabyte package (i was running low on storage space at the time), and after the initial exposure, here i am, going on 1 year of being a Guardian.

Yes, this game experienced its lowest during year 1, but ever since the release of Forsaken and Bungies split from Activision, this game has turned around for the better. I have over 1000 hours played when this game was on the Battle.net client and will continue to add more now that this game is on steam. Unfortunately while I recommend it, new players may have a hard time getting into this game. Ive seen and heard that New Light does an abysmal job at introducing new players to the current Destiny story and universe. Fortunately if you are able to navigate through this mess of a free to play idea that Bungie rolled out, there is much fun to have in this game. PvE is played out on several large scale areas where it is relatively open roam. Loot acquired from completing missions, adventures, quests, and patrols in these areas can be taken pretty much anywhere with you. Grind to a high enough light/power level to experience end game content and specifically the 6-man raids.PvP is now played in several different playlists within the Crucible tab featuring both SBMM and match making based off of connection. Here you can take your loot of \"god rolled\" weapons and armor acquired from PvE into PvP. There are hundreds of different builds that you can create and design to fit into your styles of play. If you get hooked, I definitely recommend purchasing the Forsaken and the Shadowkeep DLC. Forsaken adds tons of new weapons and armor, both exotics and legendary guns. You also get access to new raids, gambit related content, and new endgame content. Shadowkeep so far has been a blast: the Moon is an incredibly well designed location, the Vex Offensive activity is great for grinding new gear & weapons, and the Garden of Salvation raid has to be among one of my all time favorite Destiny raids.This game can be rather grindy, but to me the chase of acquiring new and powerful gear to take into the crucible is what it makes it worth it to me. This game is definitely not for everyone, but since its free now please take some time to try it out, you may find yourself liking it even if you are a casual gamer and not into grindy looter shooters", "Author": "yosi-1", "Hours": 3335.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 1, 2019", "Review": "I think the moons haunted, man", "Author": "Foti", "Hours": 805.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 1, 2019", "Review": "good", "Author": "(\u2044 \u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044 \u2044)", "Hours": 2071.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 1, 2019", "Review": "I want to preface this by saying I actually have played quite a bit of destinyhttps://imgur.com/a/2drendp about 868 odd hours.

It \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 sucks, but I cant stop playing it for some reason. I \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 endlessly about the PvP, but nothing on PC quite scratches that itch (until MCC) and I whine about how easy PvE is, but I cant really think about anything else Id rather dump my time into.10/10, this is the best worst best MMO-esque experience Ive ever played.EDIT: As of December 8th (2019), two days before Shadowkeep and Undying (though Shadowkeep never really goes away, a la Forsaken and Annual Pass content) come to an end and Season of Dawn starts... I take back what I said above. Sort of. I still enjoy Destiny immensely, and I think the game is in the best place its ever been, both in terms of PvP and PvE. Not much has changed from Forsaken (or since Opulence), and theres a lot in terms of PvP AND PvE that can be better, but... its good, and I hope itll get better. That said, I cant recommend the game right now in good conscience because of how theyre handling their monetization.So lets see what Bungie is charging for, currently, despite it going \"Free to Play\":- ExpansionsThis is fair and expected, and the content is usually plentiful enough to warrant the price. Not Shadowkeep, however, which was mostly nostalgia bait and reskins, but still. Ill give it a pass. This is perfectly FAIR.- Season Pass DLCThese are about ~10 dollars a pop, and theyll provide you with two things: access to the seasonal event (that being the Vex Offensive in Undying and the Sundial in Dawn) and a battle pass. While I can appreciate that the Battle Pass comes for free, I cant exactly say that Im thrilled about BPs existing in Destiny, because BPs are cancerous XP fills that DEMAND the player put X or Y amount of time into the game to get their moneys worth, otherwise they lose it, AND this applies to the seasonal activity. Worse off, if you fall behind, youll either have to BUY ranks for silver (which is about a dollar a pop for 100 ranks), or youll have to grind boring bounties, which are your typical MMO grind quests of \"Kill X with Y in Z\" or \"Kill Z within Y time in X manner.\" Granted, Destiny is far more generous with its XP as of Undying, so I was able to knock out ~20 ranks in the last three days easily by grinding repeatable bounties on the Moon. Was it fun? No. Would a new player without all the planetary mats be able to do it as efficiently? No.  So is this a FAIR MTX? Id say no. I think it preys on players too much for it to be \"fair.\" It also makes Destiny a job, rather than a hobby. To efficiently get to 100, I feel like I have to MAIN Destiny quite a bit, that doesnt sound appealing at all, because some weeks I just dont feel like playing Destiny. This was never an issue before Shadowkeep.- EververseThis is straight up not good at all. The grip of the Eververse is stronger on Destiny now than ever before. You want some cool looking \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 for doing that high level activity? Nah, you get reskins. Bungie cant afford to stress their art team out by designing vendor resets. BUT HERES OUR SIX NEW, COMPLETELY UNIQUE AND HIGHLY DETAILED SETS ON THE EVERVERSE, AS WELL AS ALL THESE ORNAMENTS! Yeah, no, thats \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Normally? Id be okay with it, but when youre also gonna charge for those things above? This is triple dipping. Want to see a game that does this well? See: Warframe. They get a pass when it comes to charging for a bunch of cosmetic MTX. You know why? Because the game is ALL FREE. Yes, you have a few \"Pay to Skip\" elements here and there, and Id rather those were gone, but 1) theyre all stupidly cheap, and 2) theyre not necessary to stop the game from coming to a slog once you queue up a few weapons/frames at once and have more to level than you can build. You can also, because of how friendly the community is, get help from other players, since theres so much platinum in the ecosystem.Oh, and to make it worse? Besides them literally scalping cosmetics from the games activities to slap on the Eververse/Premium Season Pass (the raid set is the Season Pass cosmetic set and they just slapped a lazy reskin on as the raid set to save time and cut costs, dont @ me), theyve severely throttled how often we get our Bright Engrams. Once every five levels, and your weekly bonus XP only gives you five levels of XP. So where before we got three Engrams, now well more than likely get a bunch of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 we dont need and one Engram, which can drop duplicates. Worse off? No more bright dust from dismantles. Those dupes? Useless. So in summary: Destiny 2 is a fantastic looter shooter, with fantastic shooting, pretty solid lore, great visuals and art direction, amazing sound design and OST, but is all being slowly dragged down because of the greed from the higher ups.This isnt a proper F2P game, Bungie, so stop monetizing it like one. Youre triple dipping, and on top of that, your laziness is starting to show.

Your time means less than nothing to them, they only care about your money. The campaign the game launched with is no more, nor are the campaigns for 3 of the DLCs released after launch. Theyre not hidden, they have been removed from the game. Content that people spent a good chunk of money on is no more. If youre a potential new player? Good luck knowing anything of what is going on story wise, all the lore that the sunset (Bungies buzzword for effectively removing paid-for content) campaigns had is completely inaccessible. Instead, what youll get as a new player is a game with a story that you wont be able to follow, mechanics that are not explained to you whatsoever, you will not know what to do or why youre doing it and instead will have to rely on the guides that players put out. Want to grind a meta weapon? Do so at your own risk as it may be sunset in future.Beyond Bungie removing campaigns and strikes (essentially side missions), they have also sunset hundreds of weapons and armour, rendering these weapons and armour useless in pretty much every single activity youd want to use them in. Some of these weapons required grinds of tens or hundreds of hours each. All that time spent grinding. Worth nothing now.In terms of content currently in the game, they recently released The Witch Queen which is a decent campaign although it shares the same formula as all the rest (stop the big bad guy). Bungie also celebrated their 30th anniversary too. What did they give to the players for this? Nothing! Unless you paid for the 30th anniversary DLC which contains a much beloved Destiny 1 weapon which also happens to be one of the most powerful weapons in the game. Slimy way to celebrate an anniversary but I suppose it should have been expected when you\u2019re dealing with a company as greedy as Bungie.Overall, Destiny 2 is a game that feels good to play but is unfortunately marred with corporate greed, long grinds, and mediocre content (that has a chance of being removed from the game).

It can be overly accessible. Its not intended for solo play.As a first note, I converted my account from Battle net, so the new players saying that the leveling and progression are broken could be totally correct.As a returning player, though, I was stunned. I expected to be playing the same game but on Steam, and instead I saw improvements in every category. I always enjoyed D2, but this is the first time it actually feels like a PC game instead of a console port.The GUI was brought up to PC gaming standards. Graphics are a little better tuned. There are no more hidden stats, and now stats tell you exactly what they do. Instead of the random-roll loot drops, it looks like the new loot is modular and can be customized, removing a huge amount of the grind. Overall, the graphics look good, the game runs well, and the gunplay is varied and satisfying. Its a good game for coop with your friends. Enemies get a little repetitive, but the game gives a lot of incentives to visit different zones and play different game modes. It helps to keep you from burning out. The only downside to that is that sometimes youre forced to play PvP to complete a bounty or progress a quest.The best comparison I have for D2s design philosophy and progression is Diablo 3. Both are designed to be drop-in drop-out pastimes, a little shallow but very accessible. Your individual gear is mostly unimportant until you hit max level, since it all just feeds in to your average character score. You can unlock all possible skills and builds with little effort, and switch between them on the fly. Theres no way to screw up a character build. Once you collect a rare item its always available to be re-crafted later, so even recycling your god-tier loot isnt a game ender. Edit: The big difference is that towards the end game, solo play is not viable. If you dont have at least a few friends at your level, many raid features will be unplayable, since any death is a \"full team wipe\" and will reset your progress.That kind of \"no risk, all reward\" game design can be a turn off, and Im not a fan of Diablo 3 because of it. Still, it works out in Destiny 2. Once you reach end game content, builds and gear choice get a lot more interesting.

My first steps into the Dreaming City. Onto the Leviathan ship with my five other friends, two of which didnt even play the game that much.

I remember the strikes, the Crucible, Gambit, and the avoidance of the Trials of Osiris with my main fireteam. But now all of what used to be, is gone inside what they call the Destiny Content Vault. Those memories culminated in a physical ring that was recently delivered to my doorstep a week ago. The raid icon now rests on my desk, and I take it out occasionally just to remember.

With the many changes this game has seen over the years I have: Min/Max no lifed PVE Did my best (never good enough 1.5 k/d quickplay) in PVPMade crazy loadouts with super niche effective circumstances.Broken 3 controllers in frustration during the years when the game was console exclusive (PS4).Nearly smashed one mouse since I graduated to r/PCmasterrace and learned K&M.Made a lot of friends that I have since lost touch.Now Im a solo player doing what solos do.  Watch Esoterrick youtube vids and curse/marvel him as he does what he does.Anyway, I vaguely remember what it was like loading into the cosmodrome all those years ago...But, I will forever remember the first time my former clan downed Crota, Atheon, Oryx, Vosik, and Calus before life got in the way and I never raided again.Quite a few QoL improvements really should be brought into this game, but I will not begin to list them hear as I fear Ill wear out my keyboard.  My absolute biggest issue with this game more than the rampant, unabashed, endemic, and disheartening problem of limp \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, mouth-breathing, gutless, troglodytic, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 eating, room temp IQ, extra chromosome, chlamydia pustule \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 CHEATERS in PVP.  More than that, yes more than that, I abhor GAMBIT.  If I had three wishes they would be, in no particular order:  A complete and total removal of the concept of \"the other\" from our human psychological ability. Greed and Avarice caused uncontrollable diarrhea and pubic hair growth from the tongue.Whomever it was that decided GAMBIT should be played with the possibility of solos vs full teams will forever more, no matter how they try to avoid it, WILL ALWAYS have the sensation of having a papercut in the webbing of their fingers.From the bottom of my heart, sincerely...\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, your mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, future generations, and your dog.  \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you....Guns feel great, some really exciting and fun exotics, some really lame ones too.Sometimes while playing I think to myself \"Has Bungie played this game?\"Well, that was a little much.  In conclusion, its free to play, you dont have anything to lose.  Stay away from Gambit unless you enjoy slamming your hand in a car door.  PvP can be fun (buy a Felwinters first).  For me, playing this game is a lot like those few weeks after you break up with your significant other where youre still occasionally sleeping together and its a lot of fun, but underneath you hate them,I still play.

Most people complaining about a content drought play the s**t out of this on day 1 and then look around going, \"buhhh? Thats it??\" Casuals will never run out of things to do (and its more than ok to be a casual) but theres a high barrier of entry into some of the real fun activities that lack matchmaking (i.e. end-game dungeons/raids/GMs/PvP) - Seasonal events are mostly fluff, some are cool, some arent. - Any expansion in the fall is always worth buying, period. - Winter/Spring has never been good in Destiny ever. You had what, Dark Below, House of Wolves, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Black Armory, Jokers Wild, Season of Dawn, Season of Worthy, all come out during these quarters and theyve all been more bad then good (although they have their moments too.)-Sunsetting is real for now, and metas constantly change. Nothing is off limits. Things you will grow attached too especially if its being commonly used WILL get nerfed or even taken out of the game. If youre very particular about hoarding, you might be disappointed down the road.The real thing youre buying into when you buy this game is the gameplay, but also the STORY. Not the PLOT. But the STORY. The WORLD. The little tidbits of lore that slowly bring the areas around you alive. The fallen guardians in the Garden, or those corrupted by Dredgen Yor. The opulence of Calus, and even a god tier crucible guardian who had a handcannon that howled in memory of his deceased beloved dog. Little things like this. Of course the big moments hit hard too during the PLOT: Caydes fate, and Rivens curse. Ghauls attack and his eventual karma. The mysterious drifter and the emissary of the nine. Eris Morn and the return of the ******. There is a lot of FOMO. Bungie hasnt figured out the solution to this yet. If you are thinking of buying this game, congrats, youve already missed out on weeks if not months of content. Granted they werent particularly HUGE things but theyre not unsubstantial either. I believe Bungie is trying to avoid this in the future but no word on what theyre doing to reduce FOMO. Also for new players: Prepare to be f*****g confused. There is minimal guidance and every vendor across different timelines will be vying for your attention. The old vanilla campaigns arent even given to you upfront (you have to grab them from Amanda Holliday) and the entire timeline has been completely f****d. Areas you shouldnt have access to will be available immediately. Characters who shouldnt be alive speak calmly into your comms as if nothing has ever happened. If chronology and timelines matter to you, this one is going to require a big leap of faith and a lot of deaf ears to let any of it make sense. Also if you are new before beyond light, you have until early November to enjoy some of the planets we vets have had for 3 years now: Titan, IO, Mars, Mercury, and the Leviathan (raid area) are all going to be sunset [possibly even Reckoning] meaning you wont have access to them. Theres a lot of stuff that takes place here and we have no idea how theyre going to retcon the plotlines that involve these areas. So if youre willing to deal with the confusing New Light at least youll see these spots. If you wait for the streamlined New Light of \"Beyond Light\" you most likely will not see these locations. Something to consider.Also you are new it is worth playing with friends - if you dont have friends and are a lone wolf then look up new player guides so you dont waste your time just shooting random enemies for hours before realizing, \"oh shoot, Im just doing patrols when I really should be in area [x] doing adventures or public events\". The game makes some heavy mistakes. It really does. And Bungie isnt anywhere close to being fast enough on fixing things. Season of the Worthy might have been the lowest place the games been in since Curse of Osiris. But the future IS bright. Beyond Light looks phenomenal, and if Forsaken was any indication, BL will be a home run, if not a grand slam. That being said. I have played this game more than most people. I have 4 digit hours on Destiny 1, and the same now on Destiny 2. I literally beat all of vanilla on console, invested nearly 500 hours into it and then ditched it deleted my account so I could start new on PC. Im still a little irate that my OG xbox character from D1 wasnt able to be cross saved (because by then my PC account was so much further!!!) but Im making myself believe my old guardians were like Altair, and my PC ones are Ezio - it softens the blow a little bit.With the hours I have in this game I will recommend it time and time again without fail. There are low points, there are VERY low points in fact, but if you are lucky enough to hit the highs. Without question you will never forget them.You will never forget your first GOOD raid experience. You will never forget your first GOOD crucible sweaty round. You will never forget your first big achievement, be it a God Roll drop, an achievement, a seal unlock, a triumph, etc. You will also especially never forget the experience youve had with your fellow guardians. There truly is nothing like this game in the shooter world, even though plenty of developers have tried to copy Destiny.Ignore the memes, the salt, and dont prescribe to the hate on the subreddit. Check it for yourself and then make a fair assumption.

I arched my back and moaned loudly as they nibbled the head of my penis.They began to go into my urethra and make little ant nests in the residue. I was thrashing on my bed because I wanted to nut again but I couldnt. My mom walks in to see this and she screams in horror. As soon as I turn my head to look, I busted the hottest, fattest nut I ever have. An explosion of ants rocket out of my penis and all over the floor.My mom runs out in terror and I begin to finally clean up. Just the thought of what happened sent chills down my spine.

The PvE Gameplay is very Fun and you can sink a lot of time into grinding. Most of the activities are very Enjoyable. Some get old and repetitive after a while, but especially the Raids (which are 6 man activities) are very nice. Some of the activities are very easy and some are very challenging. The PvP is what i dont like. Most of the encounters end with one shots from class abilitys or Ultimate Abilitis that can kill you more than once since they last so long. The current Meta is  also frustating to play against. The 3 Classes you are allowed to pick are very customizable and dont get old with different skill trees and subclasses. But another big Flaw is that F2P Accounts are mostly at a disadvantage because of Weapons or Abilities that they cant obtain. This happens in both Pvp and Pve. The Storys and Dialouge are very well writen and can be either very serious or very funny. If you got a lot of Time on your Hands I can strongly recommend this Game, regardless if you want to buy the DLC or not.

All the old story missions, raids, drops, the literal backbones of the franchise just *POOF*. Unaccessible. You know that raid you and your friends loved playing over and over again? Doesnt exist.

Fantastic environment, Great and interesting characters, Fascinating Lore but could use better storytelling.* Game BGM/OST are just out of this world, Fantastic Compositions that make the environment more alive and some even get me the music shivers.* Amazing in-depth collection of arsenal to personalize your play style, just as advertised. lots of builds that you can get lost in.* Endgame Activities are well done for the most part. These activities are no joke, but thats what makes them fun.>The Cons >.>* I cant honestly stress enough how much bugs this game have. some to the point of ruining the experience overall, especially for casual players. bugs from exotics being broken to missions/quests that you cant progress to random disconnections. i just cant* Matchmaking, in general, is a problem. in my case, I have two concerns from it. First is casual game modes in pvp being a sweatfest when finishing bounties, because of skill based matchmaking. Grinding particularly gets more tiring and depressing this way. Second is server issues getting me either laggy or non-complete lobbies. this is a big problem on the comp scene, because if you get disconnected while playing a try hard playlist, you cant get back in. also, disconnections are apparently your fault and you lose points from it REEEEEEE.* The Games sandbox is hard to adjust to an agreeable condition, because for most people, it will certainly be a hit or miss. keep in mind that weapons and armor in general has to be tuned for both PvE and PvP. so bungie does not always get the perfect formula to keep a gear balanced. and sometimes, the adjustments for some gear are either too strong, that it becomes the meta and people abuse it, or too weak, that it will stay in my vault, gathering dust.* This one is mostly my opinion, but i feel like my interest in new content disappears faster more than ever, because the new content dont seem to make me that impressed to keep me hooked in. i spend money on this game so i expect quality content to be given. not just in the gameplay, but on the structure of the game overall, because these beaver error codes are annoying and tilting already.So there you have it, I have tried to be unbiased about it as much as possible because i love this game and i appreciate the developers for keeping the game up and running. i love first person shooters, space exploration, and grinding games to get my mind off things. you really nailed the game bungie, but you should work harder to keep the game polished.8.9/10  ", "Author": "Eurydel", "Hours": 3950.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 27, 2020", "Review": "yes", "Author": "Savuthicc", "Hours": 2256.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 26, 2020", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "evaa", "Hours": 533.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: March 29, 2020", "Review": "I have more than a thousand hours in Destiny, I definitely have more than a thousand hours in Destiny 2; owning both the original and the sequel on all platforms before it came to Steam.

(it also has lots of fun emotes to d*ck around with)- Great funny times with friends- Community is livelyCons:- Only 3 Classes to choose from- Can be a very big grind fest at some points in time- Raids can take 4-8 Hours long depending how quick u get through them (but that is to be expected)- Not many people are talkative in chat. So the in-game chat is 95% of the times empty- Can get boring and tedious at times.( I suggest just taking a break in some points of time)- Still very few minor bugs, not very noticeable at allConclusion:This game is amazing. I loved it from the start in Battle.net and I still love it till now. Like every game it can have its ups and downs but that is always going to happen anywhere no matter what.

All in all, I completely recommend this game to anybody who likes \"magic\" type sh*t, armor and character design, and funny moments in: raids, missions, and strikes...or just pushing your friend and slamming them into a wall with your vehicle and killing them(F u sreg).

From a paid game to free to play, with each game and DLC launch, there is always some botched moments, giant game breaking bugs and unbalanced sandbox. But Bungie always come back with a better execution and fixes along the way.  The storyline has evolved over time. The Artworks kept getting better. I will be honest. We are yet to return to the Taken King DLCs level in term of story and gameplay. But as we are now Free to play game and with story DLC as a story progression delivery mechanism. We are at a good place to attract more users and to continue grow the game. Destiny 2 itself is first person shootem up and lootem up, with class abilities to mix up the play. 3 classes with no noticeable difference in terms of weapon type restrictions, the only differences are the class abilities. Each class has 3 sub-classes in the form of 3 elementals - Arc, Solar, Void. Each sub-class has 3 set of skill trees. Mixnmatch, but not to the same degree as Destiny 1s skill grids.Plenty of weapons to choose from, each with its distinct attributes and perks, with random perks returning in 2018, there is opportunity for the players to return time and time again to chase the perfect roll.Rewards from each activity has been evolving over time. Into Shadowkeep era, only a handful of activities will grant you powerful rewards. Public events would only ever give you glimmer, mats and a blue engram. Crucible is the PvP arena. and there are lots of modes to choose from. From 6v6 team game through to 3v3 survival. Something for everyone. The matchmaking is made up of skill based matching as well as connection matching.

One thing Id like to point out that I hadnt seen in other reviews when I was about to install the game was that YOU DONT NEED A BUNGIE ACCOUNT TO PLAY. In this age theres a launcher and another account for about everything, but not this game!Anyway, this game has great gun play and movement, as well as being well optimized and I actually like that they throw you in, but better tips would be nice as many others have said about starting the game. It doesnt guide you past the short tutorial at the beginning, however this is good in that you wont notice the big grind as you try to learn the ropes and accomplish things at the same time. It becomes addicting once you find your first exotic, it did for me anyway and I wanted more. The grind itself isnt as bad as like gta online, especially since they bumped everyones power to 750 at the start, but what I really dont like is that they put some good guns behind content that doesnt seem as polished as the rest of the game, nor is this content that everyone might like. This entire game seems built for pve, except there are exotic guns and pretty overpowered weapons that have pvp and pvpve tasks to do in order to get them and I got this game for the pve content only.Other then all that mess, Im only now starting to feel the bad grind and I am not sure how to feel about the whole season pass system. The new dlc content seems pricey and if they dont price the season passes cheaper I may not stick around for another few hundred hours. Whats an issue is that theres not enough solo content because I dont have friends that want to play this nor would they keep up with all the little dlcs. Not everyone can tug six friends in for a raid and the whole chat system isnt really used by players either for looking for games. If you can look past some of the bad, theres a decent free game here to enjoy for a while! Only time will tell what they do with it and hopefully fix a couple of the issues I had with it.*After buying the shadowkeep dlc, I think they put a bit much into the season pass.

I tried so hard to like it, but it sucks. Do not waste your money on this game. I regret spending 500 hrs on this stupid game.Main issues:1. Sweats and cheaters, you will not like this games pvp. You will get absolutely destroyed if you try to play competitively, because it does not pair you with people of your same level. Its like being silver 1 in CSGO and constantly going against gold novas.2. Quest system. Absolutely trash. You have to invest a ridiculous amount of time in the game to get anything good for fighting in PVE or PVP. You must complete quests to receive some gear, which include things like getting 200 headshots with one type of gun, going through 50 of the same pve activity. 1 guns quest requires 10 comp matches, 150 revolver kills in comp, 200 kills with a certain class of weapons, another 100 headshots with revolvers, and then a high comp rank. If you dont do these quests, prepare to get completely destroyed by people who did.3. Random Rolls - If you dont feel like playing the quests, the only other way to get decent gear is to run the same activity over and over again to get lucky. However, the gear you get comes with random stats and perks. So you have to run the same thing over and over again to get a drop with good perks. a)Lets say you want a burst fire rifle, the Outlast. b)You need to run a player versus AI game called reckoning tier 2. Each run takes about 10 minutesc) Oh wait a minute,reckoning tier 2 doesnt come unlocked. You need to unlock the mode.d)Unlock tier 2 reckoning by playing a bunch of gambit matches and completing bounties (30 mins to 1 hr)e) Start running reckoning tier 2, but its only a 20% chance youll get the outlast, and then another 20% chance that outlast will have good perksAt the end of the day it takes about 20 hrs to get your Outlast.But heres the catch. Each gun comes with something called a light level. This affects how much damage it will do. Each season, the highest light level increases. And starting this season, you wont be able to increase the light on your gear that comes with random rolls. So that means over time, your gun will drop in damage and then become unusable because the PVE and PVP activities light levels are higher than yours.So every 2 months, you will have to redo all the steps to get the same gear you used to have. Every gun, every piece of armor.4. Balance system- Bungies favorite way of balancing guns in this game is to introduce something super over powered, and then nerfing it into oblivion. Oh, and if you thought you could get a few good guns and stick with them - you cant. Each few weeks bungie comes out with a new update that nerfs one class of guns, recently revolvers, and then buffs a different class, recently automatic fire rifles. So you cant stick with one gun, because itll get nerfed , and then you will be constantly wrecked by people running the new buffed class, or \"meta\"5. Glitches - This is what made me stop playing. There is a mode called Trials, which is highly competitive. It has some of the best loot, and to get it, you need to play matches and complete bounties (requires stuff like getting 10 kills) to get tokens. You use your tokens to purchase Trials gear, 20 tokens per gear.Bungie decided it would be funny if you had to get 3 wins before you can buy anything.If you lose 3 times, youre out and have to reset your wins progress.So I got to 3 wins, and then a glitch happened where I couldnt get my gear.Fast forward to right now, and the game reset because it does that every week, and I lost all my progress, and 120 of my tokens. I spent the whole weekend playing, friday to monday, and even woke up early to keep playing, and got NOTHING. Because the game glitched and wouldnt recognize that I got to 3 wins, so I couldnt get any gear.0/10 a huge waste of time. 500 hrs gone, you will NOT like this game, because at the end of it, new gear keeps being added, your old gear gets nerfed and falls behind in light level, so you grind over and over.

Story.   The story in Destiny is one of the best is any game that I have ever played. The story on the surface is not the most detailed and investing. However, the lore adds that certain \"spice\" to it. the lore and the story combined leads to a very investing story and one that in my opinion, you cant back out of. the story has always been interesting even when more expansions are released, which is something I cant say for most games. Each expansion brings more to the table while not overshadowing the stuff that was already there.2. Multiplayer.   The multiplayer is destiny has always added another level to the game. The multiplayer has always been balanced from the single player story as to not overpower anything else. The first thing that most people think of in destiny when they think of multiplayer is The Crucible. The Crucible has (most of the time) been balanced and fun with Bungie always adding different game modes and playlists for the players to chose from. The other thing that people think of when they think of Destiny multiplayer is the Strikes and Raids which brings me to my next point.3. Community.   From what i remember from the first year of destiny 1 there were always people and groups that would help people get to know the game and give them pointers. (that is something I cant say about the community now.). People would also treat people as equals even if they have not played a Raid before or they were not good at Crucible. People were also willing to teach people how to do things such as Raids. I personally remember being taught how to do Crotas End and the Vault of Glass. After they taught me, I taught others how to do it.4. Final Thoughts.   It is a shame how Destiny has really become underwhelming. I have spent 10k+ Hours on the game Xbox and PC combined. I hope that Bungie improves the game and makes it more appealing to new players and veteran players like me.    The last thing I want to say is Thanks Bungie!

Regrind Power every 6 months for the same reasons. Completely useless and annoying mechanic. Also, the game changes too much. As a PvP fan they hit very good spots at times with the meta only to destroy it shortly after. Sunsetting feels stupid, why even grind anything anymore? You have to replace weapons even if you dont want to. Why not leave it as a choice? They took away content that I paid for. Im okay with the stories/planets actually, I think they werent really played much. But Im pissed that they took away raids. The notion that there was a raid for F2P players but there isnt anymore. Ill be pretty pissed when they take away dreaming city or stuff from its expansions. The Whisper and The Outbreak Perfected Missions where some of the best content in the game. Something I whished for newer players to be able to experience. Or play myself in 5 years again. Also Leviathan, Triumph Hall (important tool for PvE tryharders), and weirdly Savathuns Song :DOkay, so much about losing old stuff, what the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is that new stuff? I liked the opening scene of the new season, Europa looks great and it looked even better when I turned on the HDR function. But character menu, crucible and floating Ships look  worse(?!). Its outright annoying. The new subclasses are VERY PvE centric, which is a reflection of the focus on PvP in the game. Sure, new stuff is often OP but being FROZEN in a fast paced flying shooter is the most unfun idea so far. Worse than Hardlight, One-Eyed-Mask and prime Spectral Blades. Being frozen might not necessarily be more lethal or OP as other abilities, but it sucks. Is there even a crucible team? Trials is, well... Trials, but pretty unrewarding for the majority of players. I think more people would play if losses gave tokens as well. But its none of the major problems of the game. QoL: I wonder how many 1000 guns and armor pieces I must have dismantled manually. I dont want to, actually. Is Bungie not aware of the repetitiveness of these parts of the game? Please give filters for auto-dismantling! The Postmaster is so not enough. Its such a fundamental feature which would improve QoL by a huge gain, but is not even talked about for years. Its enough to handle all the mildly interesting loot you get all the time. And new systems and grinding goals there are anyway, without being showered in trash es well constantly. Just give me the materials or dont, whatever.  But please remove me from the role of garbage collector. Also thanks for removing all the planetary materials and now crucible tokens from my inventory. Because everything that was grinded (even passively) has to go at some point. Okay maybe not exotics. But since great parts of the game are changing all of the time, constantly something is obsolete. Its just so offputting that I am forced to either: take an hour or more time to only turn in materials and crucible tokens this season or: lose their worth in other materials or rewards that I want to exchange when I want to. And not now or lose it. So basically, everything gets sunset, story goes on (Just watch Byf), PvP a mess, play things as long as you still can, probably the game gets sunset directly after the last expansion comes out. Heartbreaking. There has been much patience with Bungie to improve, but now they actually worsen the game.

Maybe even buying some expansions? Lets talk.Its important to understand exactly what Destiny is before diving in: it is a looter game in FPS format. So if youre looking for a FPS looter game in the vein of games like Diablo and Warframe, this is it. Its not as complex as those games (its serving a different audience) but it shares their DNA so if youre into those games, you know exactly what youll be getting here: a lite version of those games as far as build diversity goes, but enough to make it and the grind for more and better gear enjoyable for months and years to come. As seems to be the usual with looter games, the story itself isnt particularly great or compelling and most of said story is  delivered in lore found throughout the game world. If youre looking to be swept away by amazing story-telling via in-game cutscenes, this isnt the game for you. Halo 1 this is not in that regard. So understand: if youre considering playing Destiny 2, you are (at least for now) playing because you love FPS games that offer great gun play and you know Bungies pedigree in that regard is second to absolutely no one. Youre in it for the love of grinding for ever better gear and weapons to kill critters with in PvE activities and PvP as wanted/needed, and hopefully some good story development continues to be sprinkled in along the way.Destiny 2 is flexible enough for you to be almost exclusively a PvE player -or- a PvP player, thought the game is best experienced by doing both in reasonable measure. Its end-game PvE activities (high-tier Nightfalls, Nightmare Hunts, Dungeons, and Raids) are some of the very best and most creative in the industry and put quite a few would-be challengers to shame. Music is second to none. For the PvP player, Destiny 2 -- as of Fall 2019 -- has never offered a sandbox of weapon options that are as viable as they are now. If youre new, expect to get your butt kicked for awhile (as is expected for any decent game where skill and experience matters) but once you find the weapons and abilities that work well for you, youll be on the other end of those beatings. Ill say it again: If youre looking for an FPS game that has guns that feel crisp so shoot and satisfying to use, adequately rewards your time spent with interesting loot that can completely change how you play from minute to minute, A.I./bots that arent as dumb as rocks, and a great place to play with friends and make new friends along the way...well, I welcome you to Destiny 2.

It is fun, with friends. You can have fun alone in PVE but it gets pretty stale and extremely repetitive and is occasionally rewarding. Farming for random rolled weapons in order to get a \"god roll\" is tedious but it feels amazing. Raids cannot be done solo and are much more enjoyable with friends. Content in this game feels like youre always chasing something that cannot be obtained, it is pretty frustrating but fun. However, the PVP in this game is absolutely atrocious. I like to call myself a PVP main player so I have put countless hours farming weapons to use in PVP to improve my skill. None of that matters. Bungie has repeatedly spit on our faces in the fact that they run a competitive game, only running PEER TO PEER servers. What a shame. This game has an opportunity to rival the esports scene with an extremely beautiful and skill capped game but they ruin it with skill based matchmaking. YOU CANNOT HAVE SKILL BASED MATCH MAKING WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING PEER TO PEER SERVERS. You violate the competitive integrity of the match when you pair me with someone playing from Lithuania and I live in Texas. The constant stream of no hit registration, teleporting players, extremely delayed kill confirmation ruins the competitive integrity of the game. I get it, dedicated servers are extremely expensive. BUT when you charge players almost 70 dollars for a DLC that adds roughly 2 hours of new content, but REMOVES ABOUT 15 HOURS of content AND \"sunsets\" (you cannot use these weapons/gear or obtain these weapons/gear anymore) and people still purchase it (guilty myself) and you still refuse to invest in dedicated servers, it is a slap in the face to your entire player base. The game is fun, i do recommend it if you enjoy good gun play and beautiful scenery and decent lore. Take this games PVP with a grain of salt and be prepared to grind for hours only to not acquire what it is you were grinding for. Dear Bungie,  Please explore your options to establishing a foothold in the competitive esports scene with Destiny 2 by first creating a dedicated server system as well as a ranked tier system. You have the potential of being on stages and taking over the PVP Esports scene. I hope you will reconsider this as I as many would love to explore this option and would love to have teams, and tournaments sanctioned by Bungie for Destiny.

Even just yesterday, we just shooting around, my buddy and I would pause and just admire the scenery. Both of us would comment together, wow this game is amazing! We intend to get Forsaken and move to Shadowkeep after we finish the first campaign. A little background. I never tried Destiny 1, due its release limited to consoles. I did hear about it, a cool sci-fi shooter looter. Didnt follow much of Destiny 2 eithrr only know Destiny a shooter looter along similar games like Warframe or Division.I did play Warframe for quite a bit, but never got around to trying Destiny 2. When I heard about the split from Activision, I was quite happy. Perhaps they could finally do their own thing like Digital Extremes. I have come to respect DE a lot due to their openness, constantly delivering what fans want and ethical business practices for consumers. I wasnt sure if it was Bungies partnership with Activision, or was it all solely Activisions greed or simply Bungie could not deliver what they truly intended for Destiny.So far, it is looking great. Coming from a fresh new Destiny gamer, this is truly a mind blowing surprising experience. Im not usually a FPS at heart, but I love MMORPG and good stories.

Even my son and I who were playing Destiny 2 almost everyday, got totally bored and never touched the game again for almost 1 month now.New exotic? Ok, fun for a while. Old weapons to grind for new power level? Meh. Chasing for higher PL and replacing old armor? Meh. Bounties bounties bounties! It gets old quick.

For a free game, theres an incredible amount of content Its beautiful. The graphics and the design of the environment, NPCs and the solar system are top notch Customise and gradually upgrade your character Create multiple characters, belonging to one of three classes with unique skills Vast array of gear (weapons and armour) which also changes your overall appearance Both single player campaign, side missions, and multiplayer. You can also do the single player campaign with up to 2 other players if you choose to, and the multiplayer matches contain a healthy variety of objectives (control the zone, team deathmatch, etc) Single player campaign seems to follow a reasonably interesting storyline, though I havent got far enough into it yet. It also seems to take time to get through Open world, allowing you to go wherever you want, and allows you to travel to a bunch of different unique planets You get your own vehicle which you can instantly summon to get you somewhere quickerCons: If you play with a controller, you might get your cursor popping up and remaining on the screen. Im not the only player experiencing this problem, nobody seems certain how to fix it, and my attempts have thus far failed. Its fine, just inconvenient You have to be connected to the D2 servers at all times to play, even the single player campaign There is truly not enough explanation of the game mechanics when you begin. Some have commented that there seems to be no storyline, though there is, but they can be forgiven for believing that there isnt because you have to work out how to even  begin  the single player campaign. It took me about 7 hours of side quest and multiplayer gameplay to even realise that there is a single player campaign  at all.  The game also doesnt tell you about supers (your special combat abilities) until a few missions into the campaign. I had to work that out on my own, as well as how to summon your vehicle. Im  still  not quite sure how the gear works, i.e. it says 800 on a gun, which is obviously an upgrade from a 780, but the attributes of the 800 could be much weaker than the 780. So, which one is better? I dont really know, I just keep equipping the higher number items Making friends and joining clans seems to be a bit of a ballache unless you play with people youre already friends with There is paid content, and it comes with a hefty price tag, and Im not sure how much or what it gives you.

I picked it up, thinking, \"a free game shouldnt hurt.\" Id heard of its failures so long ago, and now I was wondering how the sequel had done. I came in, half-expecting a bloody mess of microtransactions and good core gameplay plagued by crap writing and an overall failure of direction.Oh, boy, was I wrong.I only had access to the base game experience - the experience that many people loathed, that they said was empty. But even then I found hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the miserable base game experience. I finished the first raid - the only raid I had access to - with a good bunch of DLC players who were willing to lead this new player on what probably was the greatest co-operative experience in any video game to date. It was crazy! This wasnt what I expected; this was so much better.Then, they gave out the Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLCs for free when the Season of Opulence came out, and suddenly I spent myself sinking a bit too many hours into the game.Kinderguardians, you are lucky beyond your knowledge. Appreciate it. You enter an incredibly well-made game approaching the peak of its life cycle; matured, well-defined, and now finally having a creative direction, thanks to the incredible people at Bungie. Us Guardians never had that in the past, and we never had a guarantee that the game would get better. But we stuck by it, and it stuck by us. Now, you have the Black Armory Forges for free, the Menagerie and Reckoning for free, all the Patrol Locations for free, the Gambit gamemode for free, Annual Pass drops for free - so many things. You have no more barriers now. Youre free to experience the entirety of Year 1, and sample the incredible experiences that is Year 2 - and, henceforth, Year 3.I still dearly remember my first two clanmates; TofuBoy and Mirage. I hope they come back soon, even though Ive found a new home in a new clan. Its this sense of community that keeps the game going strong, and its what drives Bungie to make the game better, too. Enjoy yourselves; in the chaotic mess of the Crucible, in the hard challenges of the Raids, in the heartwrenching competition that is Gambit, the Vanguard Strikes (which, I admit, needs fixing \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665), and in all the other activities that each bring their own to the game.

My friends who still play all seem to have had various issues with the game in recent months, so the main review below might be a bit irrelevant now.-----For some context, I am a long-time Destiny fan and player, although have been pretty casual with it.  I played Destiny on PS4 since the day of release, with various breaks from it before ultimately stopping shortly after the Rise of Iron expansion released (start of Year 3), ending with 672 hours.  This might not be a lot for some people but for someone who struggles to stay playing one game for that long, this is a lot and is one of my most played games.  For all of its shortcoming -which were numerous, but now is not the time for that- it was immensely fun with a core group of friends and that time is cherished.Anyway, on to the topic of the review: Destiny 2. Oh, how exciting this prospect was, yet ultimately it was a bit of a let down when it first released (not unusual with Destiny).  The base game was pretty bad, but, just like the original game, got better with post-release (paid and free) updates.  By the time the Forsaken expansion released (Sept. last year) it was a really solid game, but I somehow have not ended up playing it much, sitting at about 277 hours prior to the Steam release.  However, some of my friends have played a lot more of both D1 and D2 (one of them has something huge like 5,000 hours-ish across both games), which might give an indicatation to the quality and enjoyment of the games.  With the release of Shadowkeep, there have been many improvements and content additions, such as the Armour 2.0 update, and there is really a lot of content to keep you going in D2, especially as a new player.  Forsaken was already good, and Shadowkeep has just improved upon it.I wholeheartedly recommend Destiny 2 to new players.  Dont let past negative views on the game hold you back from giving it a try, especially since you can now play the base game as well as first two DLCs for free.  The base and first DLC might be a bit of a slog at times (although the first time around is alright) but by the time you reach Warmind I am sure you will love it, if you dont already.  You can play D2 pretty casually or more hardcore, but regardless of the level to which you play and the amount of time you spend on it, it is really quite fun. Its also a heck load of fun playing with friends, whether you are playing PvP, raiding or just doing casual strikes.

A huge amount of weapons, abilities, etc. in the sandbox have been gutted and left to die for years now because of poor balancing in the past. The games reward structure and leveling is also incredibly stingy and soul crushing. I can spend 4 hours in Destiny and get nothing, while other similar games I can spend 4 hours and make meaningful progress.This game used to be fun, but dont play it now.

The Good: - Phenomenal gunplay, with heaps of variety and customisation.- Beautiful presentation - visuals, sound design, voice acting, all excellent and thematic.- Heaps of content, plenty of stuff to move onto if youre tired of playing one way and want to try something else.- Massive community, with heaps of good people who love the game and are happy to help newer players.- Dungeons and raids, which are unique experiences in and of themselves, once youre ready for them. The Bad: - The new player experience is absolutely terrible. If youre considering picking the game up, make sure you have a (patient) friend to guide you through it. New player experience is way better these days, though still a little overwhelming on your own.- Seasonal cycle and short event cycles can make you feel pressured to play regularly. Recent changes mean you can much more easily skip a season and not feel like youve been left behind.- PVP can get a bit... meta, and apparently has quite some issues with cheating.- Heaps of content, which can be overwhelming even as an experienced player.- Many quests can be very grindy, and its easy to burn out on core activities by trying to get a new exotic or triumph as quickly as possible.The game is continuously improving, and its in a really good spot at the moment. Friends of mine who couldnt get into it in the past have picked it up this season and really enjoyed it, so Im hopeful for the future of the game.--Honestly, Destiny 2 is like nothing else out there - and hey, much of it is free. The DLCs are certainly important to have if you plan on doing endgame stuff, but I got a good 30 hours in before deciding I wanted to get them, and I still had heaps of stuff I could have done first. Its certainly worth checking out if youre curious. Run through the seasonal/expansion missions, do some strikes, shoot some fellow guardians in the Crucible, dance in the ramen shop in the tower, maybe even find a clan you like.TL;DR: Brilliant game.

Xbox 360 and DualShock work fine.Again, they banned the Steam Controller for the big Steam release, which makes absolutely no sense.Then, several months after, they claimed to have added Steam Controller support. Only that they didnt. It literally had zero support.Now, some days ago they finally added proper support for the Steam Controller via SCAPI - so, now its right? Only that it doesnt, because they still are disallowing Mixed Input, so you cannot mix Mouse input or Xinput and SCAPI input, it has a full second timeout between them.While the game is technically playable with a Steam Controller now, its in such a sorry state that its still better to just emulate M&K or just use another gamepad.And to add insult to injury, Bungie, for some weird reason, again did something really inexplicable, favoring mouse users and hurting gamepad users: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/destiny-2s-guns-wont-recoil-on-pc-as-they-do-on-consoles/So at this point and after downloading the game 3 times, wasting 240 GB of bandwith and hours of my time, I cannot recommend anyone to spend their time or money on Bungie game because they clearly have no idea what theyre doing.PS: I know you can use a M&K config but thats completely missing the point.", "Author": "notNSANE", "Hours": 1.0}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: October 20, 2021", "Review": "Dont be fooled by my \"hours on record\", I have hundreds on PS4.

Idiots.", "Author": "Mr Goose", "Hours": 46.8}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: December 9, 2019", "Review": "Overall, Destiny is a bit of a hard game to pin down, especially in terms of providing a binary Yes/No determination on whether or not one should or should not buy this game. Despite the game moving to a \"Free to Play\" model, you are still expected to purchase relevant expansions if you desire to experience most current endgame content. Many aspects of the game are spectacular, while others are downright abhorrent. The game has an incredible potential to provide an unsurpassed player experience in the current market, yet fails to live up to this potential in numerous aspects. The second-by-second gameplay experience in Destiny 2 is of a very high quality. Weapons are varied and excel in different situations, punishing or rewarding the player as is appropriate when they are utilized effectively. Weapons themselves are pleasant to utilize and the gunplay in this game is smooth, dynamic, and generally serves to promote the \"power fantasy\" that the game seeks to provide the player with. Enemies are, for the most part, satisfying to engage with and the player has a variety of options when considering the various enemy encounters one might find in the open world, raids, and strikes. However, after spending thousands of hours fighting the same enemies, it becomes trivial to predict their movements and behavior. Almost all enemies of a given race and subtype will engage the player in the same manner, be vulnerable in the same location, and are generally very one-note in terms of how the player should dispatch them.When considering the loot in Destiny 2, it must be noted that the general characteristics of the loot have changed several times throughout the course of D2s lifespan. From static to random rolls, Mods 2.0, and Armor 2.0, the game has seen numerous iterations on the items that the game has to offer the player. For the most part, things have moved in the right direction, allowing the player more options for which to customize their loadout and more opportunities to chase a slightly better piece of loot. However, with this increased customization comes the never-ending struggle to achieve a BiS loadout, the bane of RNG-based drop mechanics & loot quality, and the feeling that the quality of items the player is rewarded with are out of their control to some extent. Any progress one makes is, concurrent with other games in a similar category, wiped upon the release of a new season of content. While it is nice to always have a better piece of gear potentially out there waiting to be earned by the player, this method of loot design can also lead the player to feel like a hamster on a wheel that never stops spinning. The power scaling system has also changed over the life of D2, but generally allows all players to reach the maximum power level, depending on the amount of time spent working toward this end and the level of content the player participates in. Currently, the game has struck somewhat of a balance between allowing players to reach max level too quickly, and locking max level behind top-tier activities and/or egregiously slowing the players progress to max level via artificial means.Individual Raid and Strike encounters are generally well-designed, and most instances carry a somewhat unified theme that persists through the encounters of a given instance. Magic heat/energy/space balls, when the player is asked to utilize them, frequently will play a purpose at the final encounter. Mechanics that arise in the first fight of a raid will be built on later. The size of these instances (particularly for raids), however, are woefully inadequate when considering the playerbase is expected to occupy themselves for an entire season in one to two engame content instances. Raids typically have between 4 to 6 bosses, and if a secondary endgame content mode is available, it usually contains around the same amount of encounters. These secondary endgame content modes are, without exception, dropped after the current content season ends, along with the raid they were released with.PvP, while not something I am very familiar with, is in a state of marginal neglect at the moment. Top-tier weapons have been so for almost a year, and balance patches are distributed on approximately a quarterly basis, allowing the meta to be defined and entrenched for months before adjustments are made that promote a new meta. The game is relatively balanced when ignoring the top 1% of outlier items available to players, but these outliers have a significant and outsized impact on defining the meta for a given content season. Time to kill is situated comfortably between Call of Duty and Halo, allowing the player time to react to encounters, while not feeling as sluggish as other similar games tend to feel. Skill is certainly the definite aspect on whether or not a player will excel in PvP, but the current metas top-tier weapons place a relatively low ceiling on how far a player can utilize that skill to dispatch other players and excel in general.The story is, in my opinion, one of the most underwhelming aspects of the game. Most compelling story threads are contained within Grimoire Cards, and not experienced by the player via cutscenes, gameplay, or other ingame conversations. A new \"villan\" is revealed at every turn, only to be defeated in the space of the same content patch. Exposition is constantly vomited onto the player, drowning them in a list of reasons why we are now arriving at Place X, and should be super motivated to kill New Villan #14. Very rarely are established story threads utilized in a manner that has any sort of effect on the players current helping of content. The lore of the Destiny universe is beyond expansive when one considers the volumes of encyclopedia entries available for the player to discover, but we hardly ever see this lore in the activities we participate in while playing the game. The player character is a blank canvas that the player is intended to project themselves onto, but the game does not allow for any real ability to change the course of events the player participates in from one character to another. Most NPCs are flat and static characters, rarely exhibiting growth or change of any kind, while those who do are not seen to have built on this change of character. Story threads are conjured into existence, and wrapped up neatly shortly after. The countless stories in the universe begging to be told rarely are, and those that the player does experience while playing the game are rarely satisfying examples of storytelling in a AAA game.Microtransactions in Destiny 2 have slowly grown into an abomination of a system, with a huge amount of customization options mostly locked behind currency not earnable ingame. The vast majority of appearance-related effects and items available at the moment are locked behind real money transactions, severely limiting a new players ability to customize their character. Vendors offer the same loot for multiple seasons on end, but you can always find the latest and greatest customization items available for purchase, providing you are content with playing the bog-standard MTX slot machine to some degree.Many players were excited to hear that Bungie recently severed commercial ties with Activision-Blizzard, hopeful that the Destiny franchise would become free to metastasize into the game they always knew it could be. The reality is that, six months out from the divorce becoming reality, the game has not demonstrably changed in the manner some expected. The same routine of far too distant content drips, rare balance patches, underwhelming stories, the same enemies but with a different skin, the same loot but with a different skin, and an ever-progressing MTX model remain, even after Activisions departure. It is very hard to recommend this game to new players, and harder still to convince old players to return. The potential for an amazing game exists, but as of now, remains unrealized.", "Author": "\uff53\uff4d\uff4f\uff42 \uff54\uff49\uff4c\uff54", "Hours": 129.3}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: January 4, 2020", "Review": "The game is good until you realise most of the events need friends.

Indeed, all of the high end activities require a pre-made party of 6. All other activities can be resolved through match making. As a solo player, its a nice switch off game for me with plenty of activities to keep me in interested for a few hours at a time. Since the launch of beyond light, some content has been removed and I think this has made the game a tighter and better experience.The Meh:The storytelling is pretty weak. For the base game, the missions are fun but the story feels as though it lurches around. A lot of the lore is found in an in-game codex of sorts so, to me at least, this aspect is a bit disjointed. Characters are introduced but no real connection or backstory is ever made in the game. You just deploy, shoot, return - time and again. It very much feels as though the story wand missions run in parallel and not together.The BadThere is nothing critically bad. Monetization is relatively fair and primarily cosmetic, the grind isnt the worst but does require good time investment and the high end activities do realistically require you to form a party in advance.ClosingI have found the season passes have improved and paid users get a slight advantage. My advice is to try the base game (Free) and pick and choose what you think fits your fondness for the game. Overall, this game is a fun shooter with a mixed \"all levels of grind\".

What isnt free were its 2 expansions: Forsaken and Shadowkeep.

Youre in the right place. There are a lot of things to do but the game at its basics is very approachable you can go at your own speed.Looking for some hardcore raiding, dungeons and high difficulty missions with 3-6 man fireteams, clans, min-maxing perks and stats, speedruning, challenges ? Oh boy, youre in for a treat.Looking for fast-paced competitive PvP ? Its got Trials of Osiris, Survival, Iron Banner and more, where you can swear that this dude killed you because of the lag as the netcode is sometimes janky. Its not the most balanced thing, metas are strong but if you like this game and have a competitive spirit, it may still be attracting you day after day.Theres so much more to this game, lots of exploring to do, things to collect, secrets to uncover, that you may still think that  youre not even close to seeing it all after thousands of hours of playing this game.As for the usual things, graphics are fantastic even on low settings. Art direction is unreal, with thousands of distinct armor pieces, unique weapons and the skins that can go with them (bought as microtransactions or collected ingame by different means). The music is so good and varied, capturing every atmosphere with the right tone, and themes that will stay in your head for hours. Gunplay is best in class, as Bungie really knows what theyre doing.The universe with its lore is also a huge part of this games appeal. Every major aspect of the universe has a huge backstory, and when you roam through all the places in the game, you can see all of it. The Travelers story, humanitys challenges, the collapse, all the enemy races, the darkness. All of it is awesome. A lot of it is shown through the game, though a lot is also told through the lore cards that are collectible and readable ingame. And all of it is worth it to follow.This game obviously has its problems, as all huge games like this do. On PC, there are some recurrent bugs that will disconnect you from games, take longer to launch things when playing with multiple people, connection problems as the netcode is fully peer-to-peer gameplay wise. There are also some hilarious bugs, most of the time coming from the physics engine. Some developer decisions may seem random, though I think they thought way more about most problems in the game than us.But overall, this game is worth getting into, as long as youre fine with learning about a whole universe and spending some time to understand it all.If youre interested by this game and feel lost, try to persevere and do the \"New Light\" quests. Theyre not much, but they teach the basics around the game. When you have a better understanding of what the game is about and want more, look around for guides on the Internet about things to do.

And Id rather play some games where they dont remove content I paid for previously.", "Author": "HolyDanna", "Hours": 400.2}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: July 6, 2021", "Review": "On Battle.net, I have hundreds of hours played, so the 89.3 above is a great understatement. I would have this about the game:Its a lot of fun, great graphics, theyre always adding new things. I feel the balance is good, certainly not perfect, but not terrible either. If this were a game you bought and didnt have to keep paying for, this would be a different review. The negatives, once you stop paying, you might as well stop playing. You cant access new content and youre basically left behind. Putting that aside, INCREDIBLY GRINDY!!! This is one of the most grind heavy games Ive played. Lets even put that fact aside... The biggest problem is everything you worked your butt off for eventually gets either taken away, or stealth nerfed. The damage the weapon used to do, is no longer as effective as it once was, once new types of weapons are released. You can stealth nerf in two ways... Lower the actual damage of the weapon, or leave it the same, but increase the health and/or armor of weapons. Both have the same effect.One of the WORST things about this game is the REMOVAL of content!! You paid for things, and then they take away access to them! Considering were expected to pay every few months for new DLC or expansions, I dont want to hear about what maintaining content costs, because we paid for that and when we continue playing, we continue paying. They built a system where you have to continually pay to stay in the game. Its practically a monthly subscription billed quarterly. Is it a good value for the money? I would have to say yes. For the hours you can play, compared to what you pay, this is one of the strengths of most video games, especially MMOs, and this is certainly a form of that. I got tired of my hard work always amounting to nothing in the face of new content. Those great weapons I loved being removed or made ineffective (or at best, poor choices compared to newer items). I got tired of them taking away content I paid for. Tired of the carrot in my face that often felt out of reach. And reading other negative reviews, I agree, they would often take one step-forward and two steps back. give us something good, then end up making a few other things worse. Its a reoccurring theme. I havent played in a year or more now, so why the negative review all of a sudden? Because a part of me wants to play because a good friend of mine does, but I know it will be an act of frustration to try to. Il have to buy the content Ive missed, then grind just to be equal (yes, catch-up mechanics help, but are just not worth it), then meet the same frustration that caused me to quit the game in the first place. For this reason, I wont play the game again and I certainly cant recommend it. To anyone who enjoys the game, Im happy for you, you certainly put the time and work in for it. There is certainly good things about the game, but there is also a lot of bad.

On steam the fun, still remains, after all the time I spent on it, and with Shadowkeep and the new seasons theres no shortage of new content for veteran and new players alike. The game provides a very fun co-op experience, challenging raids, and puzzles to figuring out alone or with friends, guarantying many hours of entertainment.Update: Forgot to mention, but the only negative I can say about the game now has been, for a long time, the PVP, especially if you want to play the competitive mode where you have progression on your rank by victories and regression by defeats. The problem with this mode isn\u2019t necessarily the mode, but the community, first, at the very beginning of a match if something is going wrong, there\u2019s a very high chance for someone to rage quit (leaving you in a 2v3 match), and second many of the players in the match decide to ignore the team and solo and not contributing leading for defeat. So right now, what I have to say is that PVP isn\u2019t good if you want to play the competitive mode 3v3.

They have flavour text for all their \u2018exotic\u2019 weapons that is great to read, and often drop little books while completing the quests of the season.It is quite unfortunate however, that the gameplay becomes stale after a few hundred hours, and you start to notice that under all the cosmetic polish, every season is only a few little mechanics different from the previous. This is just the PvE side, as there are plenty of other reviews here lambasting the complete imbalance that is casual and competitive PvP (hint: you need the paid DLC).On the narrative side, while the little elements are all coherent and make an interesting story, anything on the larger scale always clash with the backstory of the \u2018enemies of the season\u2019, such as the non-consequential power struggle of the Taken, or the entire scenario with the new season (Vex \u2018simulating\u2019 The Last City into an eternal night. What?)Now, onto the main complaint as stated at the beginning of this review.I have spent 450+ hours playing this game, along with a purchase of the Beyond Light Deluxe Edition DLC (\u00a360) a few months ago. Recently as of writing, my account was permanently suspended at the start of the most recent season. I do not know why my account has been suspended, or have any particular inkling as to the potential severe action I did for a no-warning sudden permanent ban.Was this a result of playing with random people who hacked in the one PvE lobby I did that day? Was it due to running the insider build of Windows 10? Has someone else on my friends list I used to play with banned for hacking, and I was also banned as a collateral? I have got no idea, and they explicitly state in their policy that they will not respond as to why.Yes, you read that right; they will refuse any inquiry for reasons behind account bans.Let us just quickly talk about how easy it is to contact their support; you cannot. Simple as. Their website has been completely scrubbed of any support email or phone number, and even if you call their company directly (425) 440-6800 They will still not respond to any account support enquiries.The best you can do is fill out their online ban appeal form, after which they\u2019ll let you wait a week and then close the ticket with no response, and outline clearly that if you try again they\u2019ll enforce stricter sanctions. Thanks for that\u2026.As such I\u2019m stuck with this little red text forever, for a game I\u2019ve paid money for, just for playing. Nice.

They have minor fall backs from time to time and constant buffs and nerfs to certain things which will always bring the haters out... But i love this game, like LOVE it love it.The story telling has been so on point ever since beyond light was released, the seasonal activities (except for season of the hunt) have been thoroughly enjoyable. A bug during last season allowed multiple fireteams to queue into the same activity relating in 12 man raids (instead of 6), 9 man exotic quests (instead of 3) and ultimately became the reason why this seasons activity is a 6 man.While the addition of Stasis has hurt PvP and will forever bring out peoples inner twelve year olds to call hacks, i feel like it is a great addition to show how future formats (and hopefully old subclasses) should be worked into the game.  The community for the most part (from my experience) has been great. PvP will always bring out the preteen hissy fits in EVERYONE, and PvE will always have people who know their builds inside and out. Most people have been willing to share knowledge on how the game works, because sadly the game does very little in hand holding, even for blueberries (new people to the game).Ideally the major draw to the game is the gunplay. Every gun feels different. It feels responsive and clunky (or whatever) in exactly ALL the right places. Sure we are all space wizards, but the guns are where this game shines. As soon as i get a gun i like in a season, is it quickly replaced by something in the next season. It keeps the way the game plays fresh.Do i recommend this game? Hell yea, but with guidance from people who already know it as it has a learning curve due to the poor tutorial at the start of the game.

The setting, art, style and story make it unique and easily identifiable. However, it has suffered repeated shortcomings throughout its existence. This will be a review on the whole of the game and the expansion. The good points: 1. Lost Sectors are now relevant to story interactions, lore and obtaining gear in the game. This is an improvement from previous seasons when they collected dust.2. The graphics have been updated and have improved the overall aesthetic of what was already a beautiful game. 3. The Maps are large and provide exploration potential.4. Lore has always been this games strong point and what made you crave more interaction with the world and its characters. However, its mostly relegated to collectible lore books.5. The overall artwork, landscape and in-game items are beautiful.6. The title has a solid niche for casual players who want a simple game that is easy to pick up without too much effort.7. Gameplay mechanics are smooth and genuinely enjoyable.8. Raids and Dungeons such as Shattered Throne and Last Wish are fantastic and provide puzzles, areas of exploration and ways of acquiring new weapons. Overall, this is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game for players who like to interact with the world.9. In game treasure hunts and puzzles, such as Zero Hour, are simultaneously aggravating and enjoyable as they offer a challenging change of pace to the rest of the game. These require some thought and practice as you often have a timer accompanying these obstacle courses and the screams of players are rumored to still echo in cyberspace because of them.Unfortunately, that is where the list of Destiny 2\u2019s strong points end. There are several areas in the game where the content provided can and should be either tweaked or enhanced to maintain interest. 1. The story for Beyond Light is not the same level of quality as Forsaken was. The main campaign where we first earn the new class Stasis and defeat the bad guy lasts for a very short period of time. Everything from the dialogue, story, and fights are forgettable with nothing but stereotypical villain conversations. Things get interesting after the main campaign when you are encouraged to explore and interact with the map and other characters. The inclusion of The Stranger Exo is unfortunately forgettable as well. Instead of an interstellar traveler with interesting anecdotes and experiences, we have Miss Moody-Broody X: Still a stranger, and easily summed up as a bad attitude. Other long-term characters in the Destiny story are treated with lackadaisical attention as they are killed off screen with the same care as throwing the lint from your pocket away. Other individuals that are still around in the game collect dust in the \u201clobby\u201d. 2. The in-game activities such as Strikes, Crucible and Gambit are pointless. They serve to fill requirements for obtaining weapons, armor and bounty grinds. 3. This game lacks strategy. Sometimes you get a bit of it in raids when tasks are assigned to kill a boss. However, tasks and chores aren\u2019t strategy. The lack of class specific traits means that there isn\u2019t much in the way of planning beyond choosing one of the super capabilities and selecting a load out. 4. Armor and weapons are sunset and cannot be leveled beyond a certain point. This includes items which were previously earned. Therefore, a majority of the objects you gain are also easy to throw away. This is either good in the sense that you wont have as much work grinding your power cap and stats and can simply pick things up, or it encourages in game laziness. If Bungie would include something like Legacy Armor you could earn depending on playstyle and simply reset it every season things might be better. You would be able to keep the items earned in previous expansions with the desired stats. 5. Abilities and skills are pointless except for a few which set the categories apart from each other. None of the three classes gain base skills, stats, debuffs or buffs outside of their selected capabilities. This is good news for casual players, but is another over-simplified aspect of the game. Other games have a rock-paper-scissors aspect to classes, and perhaps along with a few base ability stats, Bungie should look into implementing a lite version of this to provide a more rounded experience.6. Previously stated was that the maps were large and fun to explore. However, with the Beyond Light expansion where players gained possibly as much area as was lost. Without a fast travel point it doesn\u2019t take fifteen minutes to go from one end of the terrain to the other. Often, that makes you feel as if you should be able to push the limits of the map and simply enjoy being in the world. This is true for the in-game activities as well. Gambit and PVP are often arranged with three to four points of interest with only the topographical details varying in most circumstances. Larger maps where players might have a more amusing time seeking each other or enemy targets out would provide more entertainment, especially in a 6v6 PVP activity. A wider landscape would also offer opportunities for story exploration, discovery, enjoyment of the world at large, and more activities. 7. Because of the lack of updates and maintenance done there are several issues which have presented themselves in this game. Previously mentioned was that the story is not expanded on or experienced with updated in-game content even though lore is Destiny\u2019s strongest point. Yet, several interesting characters and their struggles are in the game and we only occasionally hear from them or rarely see them in a cut-scene. It would be better if there were more opportunities to maintain connections with these people through in game activities. Random quests to aid a character with a personal problems, updated dialogue with increased interactions, class-based interludes with item earning potential, even random \u201cI lost my shoe, please help me\u201d requests would be beneficial. It wouldn\u2019t have to be several large story line updates every week, but even small uploads would give players something to look forward to. This lack of updated content beyond new exotics makes it difficult to stay engaged beyond the weekly grind requirements. 8. Crucible is something you will only play in this game should you want to lose part of your soul and begin to hate Bungie. Rife with cheaters, hacks and ability imbalance, any triumph centered around this mode is a cruel joke. Only the absolute best, or the most modded will achieve titles like Flawless. For months players have begged for something to be done about the broken aspects of this game. Yet, there has been no attempt thus far to implement anti-cheat features. There is no skill based matchmaking and maps are mostly the same, making this a hellish experience for even seasoned pvp participants. Unfortunately, this issue is prevalent throughout the whole of the game. Rather than a stable system, players continually take advantage of, or are frustrated by its consistent instability. The broken pvp and maintenance aspect of the game is pure, senseless, soul sucking insanity. Unfortunately, Destiny never lives up to its painfully obvious potential. This capability to become something great in the gaming world is what keeps player coming back. We hope every year for an extension that will take advantage of the lore, story and world it is set in. Instead, we constantly grind for the next piece of gear while anxiously awaiting a patch or activity update, such as anti-cheat. The overall impression of Destiny is that it is unloved by its own developers. If Bungie can\u2019t be bothered to make a stab at turning this title into a fantastic game, then they should sell it to a company that actually cares about the integrity of the platform and the final product.", "Author": "Ishrin", "Hours": 1221.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 26, 2020", "Review": "We gaming BWO", "Author": "won1LayZFlip", "Hours": 2172.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 25, 2020", "Review": "Has Drifter +No Cayde -Has Zavala +is still good", "Author": "Dr. Zoidberg", "Hours": 1480.1}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 17, 2020", "Review": "pls its bungies first game theyre still learning", "Author": "[insect-like chattering]", "Hours": 139.2}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: November 28, 2020", "Review": "As much as I love the Destiny Community and all, the games a bit hard to reccomend.

PVP is also a no-go nowadays because ever since the Hard Light nerf Ive only been coming across poison weapons, so I guess thats the new meta. Dont even get me started on Eververse. Overall? Its fun for the first 100-200 hours or so, but then it just gets mind-numbingly repetitive. Dungeons and Raids are only slightly different from the regular game content, but then again Ive only finished the Leviathan raid on Xbox and havent finished the latest Dungeon or whatever. The gunplay itself is alright, but against enemies that arent bosses, its honestly quite uneventful. Dont expect an experience like FEAR where youve got lots of dust and other particles in the air as you blast someone into a bloody mist with a shotgun. But at this point theres no such thing as proper gunplay anyway since poison weapons are the new meta. Back to the PVP, most of the activity nowadays is in Elimination, Survivor, and Rumble in the Crucible. Honestly dont even bother with the Crucible if you play this game. Youre better off playing Gambit, especially since Gambit lets you get higher level gear a lot more than the Crucible does (from my experience, that is). Overall? I personally wouldnt really recommend this game if youre looking for a proper shooter, but if you just need a regular shooter to kill time with that doesnt take much effort to play, then sure, go for it.EDIT: Stopped playing PVP and completely focus on PVE now. Experience is a lot better now and less frustrating.

Some more than others!-----------------------Mic required: Destiny is from an era of Mic-bound console gaming, so mics are 100% required for callouts in complex content such as raids.

The mass amount of content is insane and completing just the 5 campaigns will give you 80 hours worth of content. On top of that there is hundres of hours of quests, events, and missions. A big part of destiny  is also the raids in the game; These bad boys are super hard ultra-boss fighst that needs 6 other fireteam members to be complete and can range from 3-5 hours of time completion. There is also a large amount of customization with thousdands of armor and weapons. On top of that there is ranked PVP and even a mix of PVP and PVE. Not only that but the maps are so large it would take forever to explore and do everything. Worth it and contains at LEAST 3k hours worth of content. Then the extra expansions that are all really good such as shadowkeep and Forsaken are amazing (PS. you get all year 1 expansions for free such as warmind and cure of osiris).", "Author": "Lil_Broccolini", "Hours": 166.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 25, 2019", "Review": "For those who just started playing the game. It might be confusing in the earlier parts of the game after playing the intro, youll have a confusing time on how to progress in the main story line which is the Red War. Some of you might even have doubts on either you should progress to others planets once you unlocked them or grind in the the same planet until you think you had enough. Youll even have moments were you doubt yourself if you just wasted your time on a free game everybody says it is amazing. And yes the games lore is amazing, only if you have the \"will\" to find the lore, and the dos and donts in the game. Destiny has so much lore to offer that are not mentioned or clearly explained in the game which some of you might (if not most of you new players) have a hard time puzzling on what is what and who is who, but in regards to the main story of the game, the game practically explains you on the things currently happening in it and what you new players must do. You might experience some of the instructions not having a thorough explanation on what to do or how to do it which is fine since youll soon figure it out or not, you could always check on the internet on the things you might have missed. The game is indeed very \"grindy\" especially when it comes to some exotic or pinnacle weapon quests (quest involving in getting weapons with unique or great traits) which then you might think you wont be able to solo your way through these quests but actually you can (on some quests) but the difficulty might be too much than doing it with friends or in a party (There are quests that are likely to be a lot easier doing it with friends or with a party). Overall, do \"I\" recommend this game? Sure, either you play the game for the sake of passing  time while taking a break from another game. Destiny 2 has stuff to offer, you just need the will and money to find those stuff.... Oh and the game is \"partially\" free (you have to buy the expansion to get more content).", "Author": "Loen Euler", "Hours": 880.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 17, 2019", "Review": "if you main titan \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourself", "Author": "drewcowely", "Hours": 47.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 16, 2019", "Review": "i love this game", "Author": "CalmRecipe", "Hours": 1975.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 15, 2019", "Review": "F", "Author": "Token", "Hours": 1277.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 7, 2019", "Review": "Moons Haunted", "Author": "Goku in New Mexico", "Hours": 835.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 4, 2019", "Review": "Overall a good game.Forced PvP for some exotics & lack of matchmaking for a lot of events are annoying (fine with no matchmaking for raids but rest of the activities can have it)", "Author": "OMEGA44-XT", "Hours": 58.4}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 4, 2019", "Review": "got me hooked immediately, i wish i wasnt broke right now so i can grab Shadowkeep and Forsaken for the Ultimate Experience, cheers Bungie.", "Author": "robot584", "Hours": 1279.5}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: October 23, 2019", "Review": "Destinys content ebbs and flows, and right now seems to be an ebb.

This game started in rough shape on launch and has since that time done nothing but improve, eventually hitting Forsaken and finishing its time on Battle.net in the best place the franchise has ever been in, and that appears to have improved even further with Shadowkeep and the integration of New Light (FreeToPlay).Gunplay/FPS mechanics, are par for Bungies course- which is to say, excellent; regardless of what activity youre doing in game its ALWAYS fun to shoot things in the face. If you enjoyed shooting stuff in Halo, youll enjoy shooting stuff in Destiny. The variation in game modes is also pretty ridiculous after years of content being drip fed into it. Standout experiences are easily the Raids and Dungeons- no other game handles complex multiplayer encounters quite like Destiny does.PvP/PvE is a bit of a mixed bag depending on what you enjoy, but if youre really not one for PvP theres nothing that totally forces you to engage with it. If its too hard/intimidating butting heads with other Guardians- you dont have to force yourself. Inversely, if youre playing a game only for PvP and dont care for PvE then you might be better finding another game as theres lots of other more dedicated PvP games that do the same job without trying to balance guns for game modes not being played at that time.Microtransactions are tolerable- lootboxes have been neutered, now if you want to buy a skin- just go buy it; no dumping money into an RnG machine hoping to get the thing. Theres also no benefit other than looking a bit swankier to dropping cash into it- Bungie have done a pretty good job of retconning Activisions approach to monetisation and it shows.Destiny is an MMO in every sense at this point and has proven itself to be standing the test of time. Great gunplay, difficult encounters to tackle with teammates, enough flexibility to craft interesting builds and a wonderful community.

I never played the game on Battle.net so this is the very first time that I have tried Destiny 2 and so far I have found the game play fun, combat is really interesting and the shooting is well done, I used the Xbox controller but I hear the PC controls are really good too so if you dont have a controller then you can get used to PC controls.  There is a lot to do in Destiny 2 and even when you are done with the story the game has a lot of after game content and some extra storys to play, and not to mention that Destiny 2 has some of the best FPS combat in any FPS game that I have played so far.   The graphics are really nice and are really nice to look at in some areas, hell even space is nice to look at and just like Watch Dogs 2 I can forget what reality is just by looking at the graphics.  Now Destiny 2 is great but I should say at least two things, now note these are not problems in anyway just two things I should point out, one the game wants you to play for a few hours at a time and that is fine but if you are one of those people who cant play games for that long then Destiny 2 may not be your cup of tea and the next thing is that Destiny 2 is really big so you may need to uninstall a few things on your computer to even run this game, as a matter of fact I think Destiny 2 may be the biggest F2P game so far on steam unless of course I am missing another game but I think its safe to assume that it is the biggest.

However, due to recent changes by Bungie, the developer, I can no longer recommend it.Positive things first. What initially got me hooked was certainly the look and feel of the game. The gunplay is probably the best Ive experienced in any shooter. The universe with its locations and enemy races just looks great and is well designed. That hasnt changed and will most likely appeal to any new player.So why do I not recommend it? Initially launched on another platform, the base game, as well as all expansions it received over the course of two years, had to be purchased. With its transition to Steam a year ago much of the content from years 1 and 2 became free while major expansions remained paid content. While Bungie has always had the tendency to make old content somewhat irrelevant with the release of new expansions, things have dramatically changed to the worse with the release of the latest expansion \"Beyond Light\": They decided to remove most of the content from years 1 and 2 from the game - content which back then was paid content. That is completely unacceptable. And make no mistake, it wont stop there. Theyll continue removing paid content in the future.Additionally, it means that the \"free to play\" classification is now a scam since basically everything that was free got removed (e.g. all free campaigns and raids), leaving free players with not much left to do.Non-exhaustive list of removed content:- 4 entire planets (out of the original 6 from year 1) including all activities associated with those destinations- all story campaigns from the base game as well as from the Curse of Osiris and Warmind expansions- 5 raids- year 2 annual pass contentLastly, a word of warning to those contemplating buying the Forsaken or Shadowkeep expansions: Dont do it.

Do not play this game if you dont have 2 or 5 other friends play with you. Some mission are non-public and you can only recruit member to help you out in chat channel. And mission map is terrible design as well, come up with lack of mission waypoint. Players are easily trap in a map or confused of how to complete the mission. Yeah I know some said you need to think about it or more likely to be a puzzle game. But damn, game should be fun and bring happiness, and all you can get from this game is confusion and angry. As I said this game was not bad, some game mode and mission are fun, but the badly system design ruin this game. Especially when you are needed to farm in more harder mission, and the mission is non-public, completely blow up my mind.

The amount of build potential between the 3 classes leads to unique gameplay tailored to how you want to play. Endgame is filled with exciting 6-player raids that drop some of the best gear in the game. Nightfalls provide a challenging dungeon-like experience with fulfilling rewards, plus much much more. There is a lot to enjoy with Destiny 2. Unfortunately there are some problems, but they usually dont distract from the main experience of the game. One last note, Destiny 2 is NOT a free to play game. Do not be fooled by the store. While it can be enjoyed as a free product, you will be severely limiting yourself to very few activities, gear, and abilities.

OEM lasted over a year without being addressed, yet the changes to LH/NF and the entire archetype of 110/140 hand cannons, repeated failed Whisper reworks, blanket nerfs to fusions because of erentil, or Izanagis rising to power following the change to autoloading yet all legendary snipers losing 20-27+% dmg based on the encounters Bungie designed themselves, all have destroyed my confidence in Bungie to continue providing a gaming experience that is fun.Edit 2: Steam nuked my edit, so Ill try it again. Beyond Light launched to a rather lackluster response. The first week of the DLC offered a campaign mission, and a few side quests from Variks which was beatable within a day. Not terribly great for $40. Following the launch of Season of the Hunt (a separate $10 purchase) and the worlds first completion of the Deep Stone Crypt raid, we got a few other activities that expanded the scope of Europa, but ultimately left not much for your endgame player. I was able to exhaust most of the content at a casual pace before the third weekly reset. We got a handful of new weapons, but not nearly enough to replace the ~75% of weapons that were sunset with the launch of BL. For example, we still dont have a rapid fire pulse replacement, my personal favorite.To address the Destiny Content Vault, we have personally seen the benefits of a faster response to patches, though we have been told on DMGs Twitter to not expect such a fast response in the future. To be honest, most of the content removed was not relevant to endgame players, other than the Tribute Hall and easy access to Greg for DPS testing. To New Light players, however, this is a very different story. To give an anecdote, I convinced a few of my friends to give Destiny a shot around the beginning of Shadowkeep. I ran them through the Whisper and Outbreak Prime missions to get them two workhorse exotics, followed by some Menagerie farm for their sniper and hand cannons, and black armory for an aggressive pulse. Within the same weekend, we tackled Crown of Sorrow and the Leviathan, getting some fantastic high-roll stat armor and weapons which became some of their personal favorites. Now, what is left for a New Light player? A non-charismatic introduction with one of Destinys worst supporting characters on the Cosmodrome where established players only visit to farm lost sectors. Worse, for a returning player who owns Forsaken and Shadowkeep, a $50 purchase, they are left with only two raids to run. Why Bungie does not include previous expansions with the newest, like every other MMO theyre attempting to imitate, is beyond me. We still havent mentioned a loss of 1/3rd Gambit and Crucible maps with no replacements, where PvP players have paid money to lose content. Gambit itself was replaced with an inferior and uninspired edition with even worse balancing than Prime, Crucible hasnt had Trials in three weeks, Strikes have become even more unbearable losing 7 of the previous 17, with two new ones on the way. Sixteen exotics have been moved to the Memorial Kiosk, where instead of completing a quest that makes you feel like you earned the exotic, are replaced with a simple purchase of one golf ball and some planetary materials. Remnants of previous decisions, such as the removal of unique emblem stats, less earnable Bright Dust, limited-time season passes (MCC did it better), the non-prestigious purple titles, armor sunsetting for no reason other than to farm more, cheaters still in Trials, reusing the same seasonal events, enemy health bars rebounding from doing too much damage, Seasons where you lose access to the content if you take a break for 3 months, constant beaver/weasel errors, farming the same raid for 12 months, the precision damage change and damage perk nerfs, 11 unearnable catalysts and no easy access to Charged-with-Light and Warmind Cell mods... it all gets so tiresome. In short, the raids are fantastic experiences unique from any other shooter, but require too much grinding through the slog of an unfun base game, propped up only by how fun it is to shoot targets with your now-limited vault, and poor decisions on Bungies end that are anti-consumer friendly with the goal to extend hours played, and to sell Eververse accessories which never seem to be in short supply unlike their vendor refreshes that havent happened in two years.

I witnessed the franchise without Eververse, where everything was apart of a well calculated, well honed, and rewarding loot system that, at the time, competed with Borderlands. Now, Destiny and Bungie are shells of their former selves, cold and heartless. I feel bad for the people who pre-ordered D2. I feel bad for the people who bought the DLC before the recent sunsetting of those DLCs or the people who spent hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours grinding for weapons that are now more useless than this game. Which is why I can no longer in good conscious recommend this grind-fest of a game to anyone. D2 is the most grindy MMO whatever RPG Ive ever played. Even games like Archage or other free to play games are not this grindy.Im glad this game was free because I was not going to buy it, and Im glad I didnt. I did invest two years playing with my friends on this game. I see the red flags even as they are now, they do one good thing for the community then go ahead and add two shotty things to test the patience and water of their own community. Namely the Transmog and shader system, which will no doubt be paywalled. If they arent theyll do some shotty thing with the Eververse (Increasing shader price from 40 to 400). Eventually, It would not surprise me if they re-implemented sunsetting. Or got rid of Forsaken or Shadowkeep. Which is also why I will not financially support this game either. Besides that the core gameplay is decent enough, but the loot system is terrible. Youre constantly praying to RNG-Jesus for the one god role or drop you want, or hoping to get one exotic engram after DAYS of constant gameplay. It isnt worth it. The first Destiny was centered around rewarding loot, and it did just that. This one, you feel like you have to invest enough time for a full time job just to get the perfect percentage boost to your character. Or a god rolled Auto Rifle which does slightly more damage when you get a kill. This game makes you feel like there should be a paid option for getting that gun, because you dont want to have to spend the next week grinding for it. The bounty system too, dont even get me started on that. Every week its bounties, bounties, bounties, bounties, bounties just to go up by five FREAKING light level. Im tired of it.Vanguard stuff is cool for a PVE player like myself, but Crucible is a Shotgun simulation. Expect every single player to be running Jotunn or Felwinter with some cheesy snipes across the map. Questionale hit boxes at time and downright OVERPOWERED STASIS ABILITIES. I swear to RNG-Jesus that if I get frozen by some hippity hoppity phat-ass Hunter, I will hippity hoppity this game out of my library faster than when Rasputin shut off as the Darkness clapped his cheeks. Raids are frustrating, because if just one player is not pulling their weight, the entire team sinks faster than your mother on a life raft.Gambit... Gambit just straight up sucks without friends.Trials is a hellhole of hackers and paranormal activity that makes you question your gaming chair.The campaigns, quests and exotic quests are mindless \"Go here, collect X amount of X, kill X amount of X, go here, collect Y amount of Y, go to CRUCIBLE and fight with this GUN nobody used since you were born.\" Rinse and fudging repeat until you gouge your eyes out from staring at the same cheese cave for HOURS because you dont have DAYS to invest killing \"Yo Moma Told You To Stay In School Fallen Sargent\" in an area that only spawns shanks. With the amount of time I invest on my Xbox, I couldve become an officer, and yet I feel like I havent learned \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 except the specific locations of cheese chests in raids and how to get to them. Save yourself some time and buy Call Of Duty, at least the guns arent copied and pasted with different skins and labeled \"Trustworthy Banana\".Edit:I went back in due to the new season to see any major changes, first off they changed the shader prices in the eververse from 40 bright dust to 300, secondly they revamped the shader system (Only good thing they did). The Transmog system is clearly paywalled, and I havent wrapped my head around it yet other than seeing the transmog items in Eververse for a dollar a piece.New Season is stupid, they purposefully make the season exotic so freaking over powered for the whales of this game that it makes you want to buy the season, or earn the gun the hard way. I hopped in Crucible and all the Hunter whales are using this new exotic to two tap everyone. Oh but dont worry, by the time YOU get your hands on it, itll have been long nuke by Bungie. Felwinter and Jotunn are still metas, and I just saw a Hunter wipe out three freaking people on a flag by freezing them and going ham with a Felwinter. Crucible right now is broken unless you pay to win for the next week.I also didnt notice how worse the Bounty system had gotten since I last played, before youd usually get two weekly bounties that gave you brightdust on top of finishing a certain amount of bounties. They removed those two weekly bounties, just leaving the bright dust amount per completion of a certain amount of bounties. Why? So they can paywall the bright dust by putting it in the seasonal rewards... The one thing that made grinding bounties barely palatable for me is now gone, and all the brightdust is inside a greedy, broken, paywalled system.At an average players pace, it takes two weeks of 3-4 hours of gameplay to earn season level 20, so good freaking luck if you have a job or a life. But this goes back to my original point, and the point of another Reviewer Ill quote here:\"They take two steps over the line and then one step back while still taking that first step over the line.\"At this point its more like theyre taking three steps over the line and stepping back once, the change of the brightdust price for shaders, the new transmog system and the shotty battlepass like system (Which by the way they removed the rewards box at the beginning, preventing you from getting the armor right out the gate, effectively narrowing down the actual value of the battlepass while still charging more for it). But hey, you dont have to buy 8+ shaders with legendary shards anymore right? Theyve had this \"new shader system\" since DESTINY 1, using one freaking SHADER is not a new idea and was literally implemented in the first game during its first year. Theyve only done this to appease the playerbase while still ramming us from behind with increased shader prices, broken battlepass weapons, paywalled transmog system, and downright appalling grinding stacked upon grinding. Dave Ramsay said (Im paraphrasing):\"Everything in marketing is done intentionally, nothing is done by accident. The smells in a store to remind you of a product, the conveniently placed kids cereal place at three feet, and the bubble gum at a check out station.\"I like to apply that same logic to games like this.You think they want stasis to be useless? Nobody would buy beyond light unless you could pull pay to win bullshite with it. Even the Pulse Rifle No Time To Explain is so freaking overpowered it can two tap people at snipers range. They know what theyre doing.\"You think Book Store owners place my book somewhere random in the store? No... Everything is calculated, and the highest paying authors get the front of the store.\" Also paraphrasing Dave Ramsay.

I had played the game previously under the Activision-Bungie years on PlayStation 4, and so when I saw all the positive changes Bungie made when relaunching the game under their own terms I was very excited. Luckily my hype was met and the game was fantastic, stunning, fun, and a joy to play. However the game began to become boring for me and my friends stopped playing so I decided to take a break and play some other games. Recently however I decided to return in order to check out the new expansion. I had heard about the removal of some of the locations but did not think it would be a major removal. I was wrong.The game is now essentially just Beyond Light. Free-to-Play players are only given access to content on the EDZ (and a limited version of the EDZ at that). Bungie essentially removed roughly 75% of the game instantly and now the game feels like a hollowed shell of its former self. They essentially removed all of the previous free raids, removed the fun and interesting quests that made exotics a joy to earn, and removed the Calus dungeon. The game feels empty and pointless and you are essentially forced into buying into the current 50$ expansion in order to enjoy the game. On top of that they set up a terrible precedent going further that they can (and will) remove previous paid content from you. It makes buying into the Destiny 2 model an anti-consumer decision as you run the risk of your content being taken away from you. Also even though you can still purchase the previous two expansions, that is essentially a useless purchase that adds nothing new to your game since those areas are no longer relevant and provide nothing to the player anymore unless you want to do the raids they included. I also want to make it very clear that similar MMO games follow the precedent that purchasing the current expansion gives you access to all previous expansions so I really do not think Bungie has any excuses.TL;DR: Avoid Destiny 2 right now, game was ruined.

Some of the problems I have with the game have been significantly improved upon; the new player experience has been totally redone improved.  I dont think it gives you nearly the background on the setting of the game as it could and should (though maybe thats actually too big of an ask), but it is a huge step up from the completely disjointed experience it was originally.  Gameplay wise, this game still absolutely nails it, weapons are varied, interesting, and fun to use.  Its really hard to say anything bad about the gunplay other than I wish there were more guns.  With the latest expansion came a \"sunsetting\" of a lot of older locations and their respective loot.  As such, the pool of usable weapons is much smaller than it used to be.  Generally it doesnt feel overly restrictive, but there are a few weapon types where it is very difficult to get certain sets of perk combinations.  This also has the effect making the Forsaken and Shadowkeep expansions essentially irrelevant in game in terms of loot.  Outside of a few exotics and the raid gear, all of the legendary weapons and rewards from the expansions cant be used in most content anymore.  Outside of that, the newest expansion, Beyond Light, is some of the best content the game has ever seen in my opinion.  The campaign is fun, memorable, and told very well.  The new in game patrol zone of Europa is a great place to roam around in and Bungie has done a commendable job of making the zone feel meaningful and in place for the story.  The new stasis subclass is also quite fun and represents a promising new direction in terms of player choice and build creation.  While it has broken the game PvP, the in game PvP was a hot mess to begin with and ironically sunsetting has brought the death of nearly every weapon quest that required you do PvP to complete making it easy to avoid it by and large.  The new raid is also excellent and has a number of fantastic feeling weapons and a new system that makes grinding for particular weapons much easier.  Beyond Light in of itself, is certainly a high point of the game.One of my original points about the game very much still stands though: this is a game best enjoyed with a group of friends, particularly a group of friends that can do the games raids.  Most high level content like Nightfalls and the Raids do not have matchmaking, though lower level content does.  Solo players will find much of the games most rewarding content is locked away from them unless they can find a group of friends to play with or are willing to LFG.  If neither of those things are true for you, this might not be the game for you.Additionally, sunsetting has also removed 5 (five!) raids that were present in the game before Beyond Light including 3 of them that were available to any players whether they owned any expansions or not.  While the remaining two raids and new third one are quite excellent, all three require a different expansion to play.  While Forsaken and Shadowkeep are both good expansions that have great raids with loot are still very much relevant to the current state of the game (particularly Shadowkeeps Garden of Salvation despite its somewhat weaker content outside of the raid), The rest of the content from those expansions, the guns and armor you can earn outside of exotics is now irrelevant and unusable.  Is it worth purchasing these expansions solely for the raids and the one or two exotic quests?  Almost certainly not, but given the nature of raiding with your friends on weekends, that might be something some people will end up doing just so they can play with their friends.  Its somewhat unconscionable that Bungie continues to charge for these expansions despite making the majority of the loot from them unusable.Overall, my feelings on this game remain mixed.  This is a game I very much enjoy.  The recent expansion in of itself is fantastic, but a reduced loot pool and the sunsetting of expansions that are still sold make this difficult to wholeheartedly recommend to new players.  My advice would be to try the game, get Beyond Light if you enjoy it, and maybe pick up the two older expansions on sale if youre having fun and want to do the raids.  Additionally, if youre a fanatic for lore like I am, the Ishtar collective has a repository of all the in game lore books  (which are written surprisingly well) that you can peruse at your leisure.

While \"looter-shooter with levels, character skills, and damage numbers popping off hits on enemies\" is where similarities begin and end, Ive played over 2000 hours of Borderlands 2 and I think theyre similar enough to be compared.Many negatives reviews focus on this games year 1 which I agree, was horrible. But this is not year 1.Pros:- As of now theres NO pay to win, all microtransactions are cosmetic-only. Also you can grind a bunch of cosmetic options without ever paying for cosmetics.- Gunplay is on point, top tier stuff.- Netcode uses some sorta magic to achieve no delay between your actions and the games response. Works even on my puny 3MB/s down and 300KB/s up connection.- Steam integration is very thorough. You can message friends, invite them to your game (and/or join theirs) without needing to shift+tab to the Steam overlay at all.- DLCs are actual expansions that actually add considerable amounts of content to the game.- This is no lazy PC port, it runs nice and smooth. Plus, in-depth graphics settings are available.- Really good in-game ambient design. Much as with gunplay, its clear Destiny 2 is a Bungie game.- In-game chat profanity filter can be disabled. Choice is left to the customer.- Rotating in-game daily and weekly side missions, plus special seasonal events with in-game content specific to these events.- You can play the base game for free (kinda like a huge demo. remember those?), no need to trust me this review, you can check for yourself.Cons:- Early game can be very confusing, theres a bunch of oddly specific mechanics and missions. When I first started, the gunplay was the only thing that I understood.- Online-only.- Bad rep from year 1 still haunting the game (it was REALLY bad).- PvP is (unsurprisingly for a looter-shooter) a cheese fest, where anything below META builds will only be victorious by accident.- The free part of the game (without buying any expansions) runs out of things to do pretty quick. The majority of the game is on the expansions.- Subjective, but Im really not a fan of the writing. Storys pretty basic but good enough, and theres a LOT of lore. But the writing is generic at best, and most characters I dont like. You can disable dialogue volume though, so thats something.- If you dislike grinding, then thats gonna a huge negative about Destiny 2 for you.

Id *highly* recommend having a player/friend help you if at all possible, or at least using a player-made guide online. Its a lot to take in, but once you get past the learning curve you might find that its a pretty amazing piece of work. Its very well optimized on PC, and in fact it runs better than any of my other games with similar graphics.Changing graphics settings also doesnt even require a restart, its all real-time right in front of you. Thats a huge plus for me. Also I must note that Bungie is taking huge strides and making big changes since leaving the chains of Activision.

I jumped out of bed running put my armor on and grabbed my guns. I made my way out onto the tower and saw Zavala standing like the pillar of strength he is staring off toward the traveler.  Zavala looked like a majestic Greek god in all of his muscle bound glory.As I ran out of the hanger and up to Zavala I slapped his ass open palmed. With a stern look in his eyes he shouted.\"Guardian not here\" then he winked and stuck out his tongue at me. \"I need you to go to the moon\"I turned away looking at the ground and unable to look at him and he walked up behind me and hugged me from the back I never felt so safe in his strong embrace. I could feel his lips tickling the bottom of my my ear \"please for me guardian\"I tried to push him away almost in tears but his embrace was so strong. \"Please...\"I shook my head \"no\"\"Come on guardian do it for daddy Zala\"He knew that would melt my frozen heart. I turned around leaned in for a big strong rock hard throbbing man on man hug and the smell of his pungent man musk filled my nostrils. As I turned to go back to the hanger Zavala shouted \"GUARDIAN\"I stopped and turned and he walked up to me and held out his hand I extended mine and he embraced cupping my hand between his soft hands pulling my hand up to his mouth extending my fingers putting them in his mouth and slowly pulling them in and out a few times moaning  \"just one more taste before you leave\" I could feel my knees shaking should I tell him \"Zavala I lov\" He quickly put his thicc man finger right across my lips I could tell I was blushing.\"Not now Guardian\" as a single tear ran down his face. I leaned in and licked the tear off his face\"I am kissing your tears away so you can be strong for the tower Zavala\"\"Gardian if you can be strong for me I can be strong for you\" he smirked \"Guardian we cant send you off into battle with your armor not properly attached\"I felt his hand on my thigh armor making its way toward my center. He grabbed the tip of my zipper and slowly pulled it up making constant eye contact. Then he gave me a quick pat. \"Wouldnt want anything getting damaged\"I could hear Lord Shaxx in the background \"Gaaaaaaaay\"Zavala slowly turned to look back at the traveler. \"Make haste guardian the moon needs you\"Drifter caught up to me I could see the hurt in his eyes. I wished with everything in me he wouldnt say anything.I could feel his hurt it was the same hurt I once felt.\"Lets be bad guys in gambit\"It was over and he knew it.I walked back toward Holliday in the hanger \"Where to guardian\"\"The moon\"\"Why the moon?\"\"The moons haunted\" I pulled out my phallic shotgun a symbol of my stunted manhood and licked it.

New Light experience a big improve but still has it flaws. Europa is a great location however it feels too empty like Mars from D1. Legend/Master version of lost sectors similar from last season is great and good challenge for solo players.

I feel it is worse than before and you just melt the boss with stasis and swords.PVP is now a beyond joke because, the meta hasnt changed and it is just hand cannons, snipers, shotguns and the odd auto and No Time to Explain. Hand Cannon range is back how it was a few season back when it was the similar to sniper range.UI: It is cleaner and liking the dark theme, works this expansion.Lore: it is much better but wish bungie could add the web lore within the game.I feel this is using a older build with new feature but missing the updates from previous seasons. I understand that majority of the developers are working from home and the lack of play testing. If Bungie still struggling to make content then why still using the same engine and tools.

The game itself is massive with the amount of weapons, armor, and cosmetics to ships to emotes and so forth. The gameplay is overall solid shooter with some super abilities and pretty low learning curve. The dlc is solid from the new forsaken dlc to the moon dlc. The game is ever evolving with new events literally every week. Every week you are given weekly challenges to do to upgrade your character. Each character is unique in their own play style. But at the moment warlocks are the overall strongest for raids because of the current loadouts. Some of the most basic neccessites to speed run content are the Izanagis burden which is a sniper exotic, the Recluse which is a secondary slot smg, and the heavy weapon can be either wendigo grenade launcher, 21% delerium which is a lmg, or a grenade launcher with spike grenade perks. Quick thing I am literally writing this just for the 2019 nominee badge so if need to elaborate anything comment below. Also the game itself is not bad for newcomers because even without the dlc there is a ton of content to do with friends. Ive played literally everything from raids to strikes to exotic quests and heroic quests to pvp events like iron banner and the cupid duo pvp events. I pretty much stayed with the game since the beginning of its time in battle.net and the game pretty much has been updating itself constantly to keep the community and fanbase going. Honestly the game itself is pretty solid if you like shooters and that if you want to play a game with friends this is a solid choice to go with till something else comes out in the future. If you are a person that needs help with content because either no one is on or no one wants to play destiny there are reddit pages with plenty of people willing to help as well as discords of people that need help with the same content. Even raids people are willing to help you out and even teach you step by step what to do. Dont be discouraged with the massive amount of content just take it step by step. Lastly when you start the game you will be power level 700 your goal it to get to 900 so then you can do weekly challenges to try and level to power level 950. If you enjoy the game to that point getting the dlc will give you a artifact that can increase your power level infinitely based off the experienced gathered into it, you can just look it up but at this time the artifact is like 20-30 days left. Got some time try the game at this point i am just rambling but either way not a bad game to pick just that the go to loadout is pretty much universal with those weapons above and that when raiding you need a handful of exotics to switch back and forth because exotics are huge buffs to certain areas of your character itself. Even though the warlock is prominent in general all the classes are solid overall I mostly play hunter but since my clan is full of bunch of monkeys I have every class ready to do anything. If you want to power level characters just level up one character to as high as you can then you can just drag the high power level weapons over to the other character to level them faster. Also for real this time lastly google destiny item manager and its the best way to move your items around your inventory without going back to the main base and sorting stuff.

Destiny captured me since the beginning, the complex world, systems and activities were always something that excited me. The raids, even the ones which were removed (Well get to this in a bit), are an unmatched experience in my honest opinion. It was a tool to make friends, teach people and just have a blast of a time. At first I was a PvE only player, I couldnt handle PvP because all of the quirks and mechanics I couldnt keep up with, but after a while (More like 5 years) I started to get a lot more involved with the PvP community and it has been so much fun.PvP is a Beast of its own, Sandbox could be better but its day and night compared to the launch of Beyond Light with the Launch Version of Stasis. Trials Getting a rework is extremely promising and Im just cheering for it to be a success.As I mentioned before, End game content such as raids is unmatched in my opinion, good mechanics, good community (mostly, Im looking at you PC LFG). Playing the PvE content has led me to meet some of my closest online friends. Definetly cant complain on the PvE side of the game.Now to the controversial part of the review. Sunsetting. This is a term which Bungie uses to refer to the removal of content and weapons from the game. This has led to my biggest pain. The content that was removed featured some of the most fun raids the franchise has ever seen (R.I.P. SoTP) and Im incredibly sad that its gone... If Bungie ever brings back the raids that were removed, honestly, that would be the best timeline, and we can only hope and pray. Overall Destiny is a very fun Franchise, which WILL suck you in if you let it, the universe, lore and story is enticing and fun. Bungie is a Company made from humans who are bound to make mistakes (*Cough* *Cough* Sunsetting) but the game is in a really good place for both returning and new players.

Destiny 2s development has always been quite volatile and therefor has the issue that the game has some areas that are super well expended with great detail while other parts of the game feel unfinished and forgotten. While Bungie does regularily rework and revitalize content it takes alot of time and sometimes that time can feel like forever. Overall, destiny is a game with amazing gunplay and interesting and unique loot that has a vast amount of activities that all feel different but not different enough. I feel it important to note that the pricing structure for this game is basically (but not actually) a monthly sub with 1 expansion every year (aswell as microtransactions). If this is not an issue for you, you might aswell try it but for the gamers out there with not that much money i would be thinking twice before diving into destiny as long time engagement might end up costing a pretty buck.I think alot of people can agree when i say that Destiny players love destiny but wouldnt recomend their friends to start playing because Destiny is like League of Legends where everyone has a love hate relationship for the game. The community can also be Quite toxic at times especially at higher end content where gatekeeping is the defacto mindset.", "Author": "Lucy", "Hours": 2123.9}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: April 25, 2020", "Review": "Product received for free", "Author": "Bird but really fat", "Hours": 2377.5}, {"Recommended": false, "Date": "Posted: April 9, 2020", "Review": "Great game overall but the crucible made me uninstall, super laggy if you dont have a lot of upload speed, you will rage a LOT.(killed after you killed your enemy, bullet not registering, making your overall internet lag for example when i get into a crucible match or when i shoot someone i go from 30 ping on discord to 250 for no reason, dying behind cover anyways i can continue for ages)", "Author": "TFM", "Hours": 788.2}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: December 27, 2019", "Review": " Great game Like all other games this one also has to improve in many ways: bug. Despite this, it has a fascinating story, moreover, it has 5 stories! The game itself is based on farming; Do you want a new and better weapon? Farm it! But leaving the farm aside, we have about 20-25 hours of very good stories only! Assaults, raids, PvP and gambit (a PvE + PvP mode), apart from seasonal missions!Said that this game has a lot to offer, lots of things to collect, scan and farm. As long as you have a lot of free time or a very fat wallet, you can complete it almost 100%. And what you have left will be limited time weapons/decorations with the season pass or some event.I loved this game at first sight, but as I was doing the missions, collecting things, trying to complete the game at 100%, I get tired. Simply because I was realizing that I can never complete it at 100%. But one thing is clear, I loved the story!  With stories they told, there is a lot to think about this world  Pros + Very good graphics, even so, playing with the minimum settings.+ The music does not bother the ear, it fits very well. There are times when you dont even know that music is playing xD+ Many game modes and many things to do.+ Charismatic characters with their own stories.+ It has arrow and projectile physics.+ \"Sparrow\" vehicles to travel faster on the ground.+ Many types of armor, weapons, gestures, colors, Sparrows ...+ They offer us 3 free and 2 paid stories. I dont regret buying all the stories. Cons - You can not get all the achievements within the game. But you can get all of them on Steam.- You can not get all the weapons, armor, and some other things since this is a time-limited content.- The controls are good, but it is in cons for the following - in PvP, there are people who use the gamepad so they walk as if they had aimbot.- It can become too addictive and monotonous.- There are some missions that are about parkour and limited time, it can be quite complicated to complete these missions. Is it worth it Definitely, yes! Just to know the 3 stories offered for free, its already a lot. The other two stories that are with DLC, are also worth it, only if you liked the first 3 stories. There are many things to discover, Easter eggs, and others. I would not recommend wasting time trying to get everything this game offers, it is impossible. But, when youve done the main stories, you can try and have fun with PvP and PvE modes,  open world, or just enjoy the views this game has.9/10 \"The 3 stories this game offer for free, worth it!\"For more non-competitive and head frustrating games follow:  Our Curator And check out  Our Group  for giveaways and discussions", "Author": "v.X-KBM", "Hours": 777.8}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 17, 2019", "Review": "Very Nice Game!!!!! highly optimized", "Author": "momentum", "Hours": 57.6}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 11, 2019", "Review": "not gonna lie the 1 was bad but this is my favorite game", "Author": "Gucci", "Hours": 29.9}, {"Recommended": true, "Date": "Posted: November 9, 2019", "Review": "Pretty fun shooter-looter MMOFPS!
